# vintage-wiki-rag

A retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) app for exploring vintage mechanical keyboard knowledge. 

The project ingests pages from the Mechanical Keyboard Club Wiki (successor to the Deskthority Wiki), normalizes them, and makes them searchable through embeddings + vector search.

Currently, the system focuses on Alps Electric switches (~160 articles), with plans to expand to the entire ~3,000-page wiki.
