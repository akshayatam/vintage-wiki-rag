The original catalogue was in colour, and was scanned to PDF. Black and white photostat copies were also made and passed to various people. The original catalogue and the PDF document are considered lost, as are all photocopies besides Sandy's, which is the only copy known to remain.\n\nThe catalogue is known to cover the following switches:\n\nSKCL\n\nSKCLAR, SKCLAQ, SKCLJC, SKCLFQ, SKCLFM, SKCLBB\n\nSKCM\n\nSKCMAP, SKCMAQ, SKCMAT, SKCMBB\n\nSKFR\n\nSKFRAC, SKFRAD, SKFRFA, SKFRFB, SKFRFC\n\nSKFS\n\nSKFSAA\n\nThe owner of the catalogue asked [Alps Electric](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_Electric \"Alps Electric\") for permission to republish it, and was denied. Photos provided from Sandy depicting parts of pages (but not whole pages) were posted to Deskthority and Geekhack before Alps's prior restriction was noted.\n\nThe SKCL/SKCM part numbers come from Sandy's transcript. SKFR/SKFS part numbers likely also came from Sandy; currently the only confirmed details are in an archive of geekhack wiki, which itself cited this same catalogue.<ref name=\"gh-Alps\">Geekhack — [Default:ALPS switches](http://archive.today/45sFi) (archive) Archived 2014-01-12. Retrieved 2015-07-22.</ref>\n\nTranscript\n----------\n\n\\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=1994_Alps_catalogue&veaction=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Transcript\") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=1994_Alps_catalogue&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section's source code: Transcript\")\\]\n\nSandy provided the following notes in November 2013 (taken from a plain text e-mail). Whether they are verbatim or summarised is not known, and none of the explanatory text should be considered official Alps information without clarification.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the two series are given as \"CL series\" and \"CM series\" instead of \"SKCL\" and \"SKCM\", which partially corresponds with the catalogue fragment (from an older catalogue) that identified [Alps SKCM Cream](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCM_Cream \"Alps SKCM Cream\") (SKCMAF) and [Alps SKCM Blue](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCM_Blue \"Alps SKCM Blue\") (SKCMAG). Although \"SKCL/SLCM series\" was used in an official Alps document, this may indicate a terminology revision. (The text below is given verbatim, including typing mistakes and transcription errors. For example, \"SLCLAQ\" should read \"SKCLAQ\")\n\nCL series ( All Linear) SKCLAR; Yellow, 0.588N SLCLAQ; Grey, 0.882N ( maybe be same one with space bar sw in Zenith ZKB-2 SKCLJC; Grey, 1.47N, Altenate type( referred as ALPS CM lock in deskthority ) SKCLFQ; Yellow with Red LED SKCLFM; Yellow with Green LED SKCLBB; White, Double action CM series.

CM compact is not listed in '94 catalog.
