It was produced in partnership with [Alps Electric](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_Electric \"Alps Electric\") until 2000, after which production continued until 2012 without the Alps branding.\n\nContents\n--------\n\n*   [1  Nomenclature](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKBM#Nomenclature)\n*   [2  History](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKBM#History)\n*   [3  Details](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKBM#Details)\n    *   [3.1  Recognition](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKBM#Recognition)\n    *   [3.2  Criticism](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKBM#Criticism)\n*   [4  Variants](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKBM#Variants)\n    *   [4.1  Official](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKBM#Official)\n    *   [4.2  Discovered](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKBM#Discovered)\n*   [5  Gallery](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKBM#Gallery)\n*   [6  Specifications](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKBM#Specifications)\n*   [7  External links](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKBM#External_links)\n*   [8  References](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKBM#References)\n\nNomenclature\n------------\n\n\\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKBL/SKBM_series&veaction=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Nomenclature\") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKBL/SKBM_series&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section's source code: Nomenclature\")\\]\n\nForward's SKBL and SKBM series are commonly known as \"Fuhua\" and \"Fukka\" switches. \"Fuhua\" comes from the mistaken use of the company's Chinese name (福華電子股份有限公司 – Fuhua Electronic Co. Ltd.) instead of their English language name of Forward Electronics. This in turn got corrupted to \"Fukka\", a term that has seen consistent use to this day.\n\nSKBL and SKBM are the official series names as once found on the Forward Electronics website.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n\\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKBL/SKBM_series&veaction=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: History\") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKBL/SKBM_series&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section's source code: History\")\\]\n\nAccording to Forward Electronics, SKBL/SKBM series was introduced in 1991.<ref name=\"C-Fwd\" /> However, the earliest discovered examples of keyboards using these switches are from 1995, in particular the [Forward Electronics FDA-102D](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Forward_Electronics_FDA-102D \"Forward Electronics FDA-102D\"). Forward Electronics specifications SKBL-E01 and SKBM-E01 both appear to be from 1995, which fits in with the earliest sightings of the switches.\n\n[Alps Electric](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_Electric \"Alps Electric\") ended their 30-year joint venture with Forward Electronics in March 2000;<ref name=\"Alps-Forward-Split\" /> from this point onwards, until the product series was discontinued in early 2012, there was no relationship with Alps.\n\nAround the time that the [Matias Tactile Pro 2.0](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Matias_Tactile_Pro_2.0 \"Matias Tactile Pro 2.0\") was introduced, the \"ALPS\" branding disappeared from the switches; Edgar Matias has reported that Forward Electronics lost their licence to use the Alps branding, requiring switch retooling.\\[Citation needed\\] What is known is that the switches were rebranded: the new-style Alps logo was removed from the top, and the old oval logo on the bottom was replaced by the letters \"F D\". The design drawings were amended to match.\n\n[Matias Corporation](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Matias_Corporation \"Matias Corporation\") was responsible for continued production of SKBL/SKBM switches, by taking a gamble on the million-switch order required to keep the factory alive; this was required to maintain production of the switches used in the original [Tactile Pro](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Matias_Tactile_Pro \"Matias Tactile Pro\").\\[Citation needed\\] However, production was finally terminated in early 2012. The final batches of the [Tactile Pro 3](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Matias_Tactile_Pro_3 \"Matias Tactile Pro 3\") had to use their new [Matias switch](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Matias_switch \"Matias switch\"), as stocks of SKBM switches ran out prematurely. The Matias switch is a clone of the SKBL/SKBM series.\n\nDetails\n-------\n\n\\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKBL/SKBM_series&veaction=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Details\") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKBL/SKBM_series&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section's source code: Details\")\\]\n\nSKBL/SKBM series switches have significantly less [mould numbering](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Mould_numbering \"Mould numbering\") compared to SKCL/SKCM. The encircled characters are not present; the only characters appear to be mould cavity identification. The numbering consists of a single alphanumeric character in each of the north-west and north-east positions. This numbering pattern appears to be unique amongst Alps switches and clones, and is a useful guide when examining a switch with no branding, which could be early complicated or late simplified.\n\n### Recognition\n\n\\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKBL/SKBM_series&veaction=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Recognition\") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKBL/SKBM_series&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section's source code: Recognition\")\\]\n\nSimplified Alps switches share the same exterior design as complicated Alps, but the logo and [mould numbering](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Mould_numbering \"Mould numbering\") differ, making recognition fairly straightforward. Although there are several differences between simplified Alps switches and archetypal complicated Alps switches, there are also numerous variations of complicated white Alps, and the redesigned mould numbering is the only difference that appears to be specific to simplified Alps.\n\n*   [Archetypal complicated Alps switch; later switches lost the slits, and older switches lacked the Alps logo on the top](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Special:Upload&wpDestFile=Switch_recognition--Alps--SKC_pine.svg \"File:Switch recognition--Alps--SKC pine.svg\") Archetypal complicated Alps switch; later switches lost the slits, and older switches lacked the Alps logo on the top \n*   [Simplified Alps, with simple numbering, heavily raised bold Alps logo, and the contacts at the front, causing it to appear \"upside down\"](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Special:Upload&wpDestFile=Switch_recognition--Alps--Simplified.svg \"File:Switch recognition--Alps--Simplified.svg\") Simplified Alps, with simple numbering, heavily raised bold Alps logo, and the contacts at the front, causing it to appear \"upside down\" \n*   [Later simplified Alps switches with the logo removed; these appear to all have the writing orientation corrected](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Special:Upload&wpDestFile=Switch_recognition--Alps--Simplified_without_logo.svg \"File:Switch recognition--Alps--Simplified without logo.svg\") Later simplified Alps switches with the logo removed; these appear to all have the writing orientation corrected\n\n### Criticism\n\n\\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKBL/SKBM_series&veaction=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: Criticism\") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKBL/SKBM_series&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section's source code: Criticism\")\\]\n\nIt has a reputation for being loud.\n\nThe springs in the keyboard could reverberate and cause noise when any key is pressed to the bottom hard enough. That sound has been called \"[ping](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Ping \"Ping\")\" or \"the chorus of springs\".\n\nVariants\n--------\n\n\\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKBL/SKBM_series&veaction=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: Variants\") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKBL/SKBM_series&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section's source code: Variants\")\\]\n\n### Official\n\n\\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKBL/SKBM_series&veaction=edit&section=7 \"Edit section: Official\") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKBL/SKBM_series&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit section's source code: Official\")\\]\n\nThe official list of models is as follows, taken from the Forward Electronics website in 2004 and 2008, with the colours taken from the design drawings:\n\nModel\n\nType\n\nOperating force\n\nOfficial colour\n\nSKBLFE\n\nLinear\n\n60 gf\n\nYellow\n\nSKBLFF\n\nLinear\n\n90 gf\n\nSKBMFA\n\nClicky\n\n70 gf\n\nWhite\n\nSKBMFB\n\nTactile\n\n70 gf\n\nLifetime is given as 10 million cycles, and bounce time as 5 ms maximum. The switches are rated for DC 12 V 100 mA maximum. Contact resistance is 1 Ω maximum initially, and 5 Ω maximum at end of life.\n\nThe schematic for SKBLFE shows no position for an LED, and Forward SKBL Black indeed has no LED slot. However, a small monochrome photograph on the Forward Electronics website in 2004 showed a linear switch with integrated LED. No mention is ever made of this discrepancy, and no LED switch has been sighted; Matias keyboards used [Xiang Min KSB-N](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Xiang_Min_KSB-N \"Xiang Min KSB-N\") switches for the illuminated keys instead.\n\n### Discovered\n\n\\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKBL/SKBM_series&veaction=edit&section=8 \"Edit section: Discovered\") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKBL/SKBM_series&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit section's source code: Discovered\")\\]\n\nActual discovered switches do not appear to correspond fully with the published specifications. In particular, the use of colour seems to be arbitrary, with clicky switches being found in white, black and grey, and black switches in clicky, tactile and linear forms. Inspection of \"F D\"–branded white and grey switches shows no difference of any kind except for the slider colour. The existence of both colour sliders in both Alps **and** Forward branding remains a mystery.\n\n\"Alps\" below refers to Alps-branded switches, and \"Forward\" to Forward-branded switches.\n\nSwitch\n\nKey
