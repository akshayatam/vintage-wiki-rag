You can help Deskthority by [expanding it](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Simplified_Alps_Type_III&action=edit).*\n\nSimplified Alps Type III\n\nManufacturer\n\nUnknown\n\nSwitch type\n\nClicky\n\nSense method\n\n[Metal leaf](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Contact_mechanism#Metal_leaf \"Contact mechanism\")\n\nKeycap mount\n\n[Alps mount](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Keycap_mount#Alps_mount \"Keycap mount\")\n\nSwitch mount\n\n[Plate mount](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Switch_mount#Plate_mount \"Switch mount\")\n\n**Simplified Alps Type III** is a switch that combines [Hua-Jie AK series](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Hua-Jie_AK_series \"Hua-Jie AK series\")\\-style internals with what appear to be genuine Alps shells. The switch shell resembles that of genuine [Alps SKCM Blue](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCM_Blue \"Alps SKCM Blue\"), including the long side tabs, but some of the numbering is missing. Since complicated Alps shells cannot support simplified mechanisms, the switch contains a small support frame to hold the contact plates apart; the frame has approximately the same overall thickness as the [switchplate](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Switchplate \"Switchplate\") that would normally be present.\n\nOne suggestion was that the shells were stolen rejects from a factory producing genuine Alps switches. Switches that appear to be genuine white Alps have since been found with these same unbranded, incompletely-numbered upper shells, in the [DSI Modular Pro](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/DSI_Modular_Pro \"DSI Modular Pro\") keyboard. Dates in the Modular Pro keyboard are all from mid 1990. Webwit's Datacomp DFK191A301 also appears to have these erroneous switches.<ref>Deskthority â€” [The Wild Duck Exotics Boutique](https://deskthority.net/f-o-r-s-a-l-e-f58/the-wild-duck-exotics-boutique-t10089.html)</ref> As a note, the varying orientation of the circled numbers suggests that these positions are batch numbers using drop-in cylinders, similar to the date wheels found in keyboard case moulds. The reason for the missing numbers is not clear.\n\nThe switch also has an uncharacteristic vivid blue [slider](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Slider \"Slider\"), only otherwise found in [Taiwan Tai-Hao APC series](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Taiwan_Tai-Hao_APC_series \"Taiwan Tai-Hao APC series\") switches.\n\nThis switch is only known to exist in the [Focus FK-2001](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Focus_FK-2001 \"Focus FK-2001\") keyboard.\n\nAlps.tw Type OA1\n----------------\n\n\\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Simplified_Alps_Type_III&veaction=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Alps.tw Type OA1\") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Simplified_Alps_Type_III&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section's source code: Alps.tw Type OA1\")\\]\n\nMain article: [Alps.tw Type OA1](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps.tw_Type_OA1 \"Alps.tw Type OA1\") \n\nalps.tw previously referred to type \"OA1\" as being Simplified Alps Type III. It has since been determined to be a similar, but distinct and potentially unrelated switch. The key difference between the two is that Simplified Alps Type III appears to use real Alps shells, while Type OA1 has custom-moulded replica shells with integrated support for clone switch contacts, with no need for a support frame.\n\nGallery\n-------\n\n\\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Simplified_Alps_Type_III&veaction=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Gallery\") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Simplified_Alps_Type_III&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section's source code: Gallery\")\\]\n\n*   [![Switch partially disassembled;
