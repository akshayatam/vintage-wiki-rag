First introduced as early as 1983,<ref name=\"MouseFan\" /> the Alps SKCL/SKCM series has been one of the first commonly available, compact-design keyboard switches. Over the years there have been many variants of the keyswitch, including changes in colour and design. Early variants of the Alps switch did not carry the Alps logo on the top part of the case, and only had it moulded into the base of the switch.\n\nThe terms \"ALPS\" and \"Alps\" are widely misused to refer to a large number of [clone](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_clone \"Alps clone\") switches manufactured by other companies, as well as similar-looking switches that share the same [keycap mount](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Keycap_mount \"Keycap mount\"); although most clones are clearly different from genuine Alps switches, they are similar enough that many people fail to differentiate Alps switches from the copies.\n\nContents\n--------\n\n*   [1  Nomenclature](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/ALPS_switch#Nomenclature)\n*   [2  Evolution](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/ALPS_switch#Evolution)\n    *   [2.1  Generations](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/ALPS_switch#Generations)\n*   [3  Design](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/ALPS_switch#Design)\n    *   [3.1  Shell](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/ALPS_switch#Shell)\n    *   [3.2  Slider](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/ALPS_switch#Slider)\n    *   [3.3  Leaf springs](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/ALPS_switch#Leaf_springs)\n        *   [3.3.1  Modification](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/ALPS_switch#Modification)\n    *   [3.4  Switchplate](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/ALPS_switch#Switchplate)\n    *   [3.5  Latching action](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/ALPS_switch#Latching_action)\n    *   [3.6  Slits](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/ALPS_switch#Slits)\n    *   [3.7  Logo](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/ALPS_switch#Logo)\n*   [4  Simplified Alps](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/ALPS_switch#Simplified_Alps)\n*   [5  Recognition](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/ALPS_switch#Recognition)\n*   [6  Korean switches](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/ALPS_switch#Korean_switches)\n*   [7  Variants](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/ALPS_switch#Variants)\n*   [8  Keyboards](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/ALPS_switch#Keyboards)\n*   [9  Specifications](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/ALPS_switch#Specifications)\n*   [10  Maintenance](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/ALPS_switch#Maintenance)\n*   [11  External links](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/ALPS_switch#External_links)\n*   [12  References](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/ALPS_switch#References)\n\nNomenclature\n------------\n\n\\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series&veaction=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Nomenclature\") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section's source code: Nomenclature\")\\]\n\nAlps SKCL/SKCM series has gone by many names, owing to widespread misunderstanding. It also appears that the series name changed within Alps. The [1994 Alps catalogue](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/1994_Alps_catalogue \"1994 Alps catalogue\") apparently referred to \"**CL series**\" and \"**CM series**\", indicating that the previous community name \"**Alps CM**\" may be correct, for a subset of the switches (the tactile and clicky models). A catalogue fragment for [Alps SKCM Blue](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCM_Blue \"Alps SKCM Blue\") also suggests CM series or even KCM. The Alps data sheet below—depicting what seems to be bamboo white (SKCLCQ)—uses the term \"SKCL/SKCM series\" (\"SKCL／SKCMシリーズ\"), suggesting that Alps changed the series name in the mid 90s; there was also very tentative evidence that [Alps SKFL series](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKFL_series \"Alps SKFL series\") was referred to in this manner.\n\n\"Bigfoot\" as a moniker derives from the term \"[Alps Bigfoot](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_Bigfoot \"Alps Bigfoot\")\" used to refer to the Alps standard keyboard platform. The term \"Complicated Alps\" comes from the complexity of the design, with a fairly high 10–13 [parts per switch](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Parts_per_switch \"Parts per switch\"), especially in comparison to the \"simplified\" [Alps SKBL/SKBM series](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKBL/SKBM_series \"Alps SKBL/SKBM series\") that followed it.\n\nThere is no known name or term that covers both complicated (SKCL/SKCM) and simplified ([SKBL/SKBM series](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKBL/SKBM_series \"Alps SKBL/SKBM series\")) switches. According to Sandy, 'SK' stands for \"single key\"; \"SK\" is used in the part numbers of many Alps switches.<ref name=\"Alps\\_TACT\" />\n\nEvolution\n---------\n\n\\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series&veaction=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Evolution\") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section's source code: Evolution\")\\]\n\nSKCL/SKCM series itself appears to a [DIN standard](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/DIN_standard \"DIN standard\") re-imagining of the earlier [Alps SKCC series](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCC_series \"Alps SKCC series\"). The \"switchplate\" contact assembly was lifted wholesale from the earlier switch; the important changes were repositioning the mounting plate to be much lower down the switch body, and a new slider design that allowed the mounting stem within the keycap to pass inside the switch. While SKCC and SKCL/SKCM are around the same size as each other, these changes permitted a substantial reduction in keyboard profile without altering the switching operation in any way. The redesigned shell also brought with it a different approach to illumination, placing the LED inside the switch instead of supported above it on coil springs.\n\nThe exact design goals are currently unknown. The new shell left space to introduce a [click leaf](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Click_leaf \"Click leaf\") in place of the LED. Because the slits in the tactile switch shell are shorter than the slits of the linear switch, it would seem that this was an afterthought; later linear switches adopted the shorter slits when the shells were retooled at the end of the 1980s. The early history remains speculation, due to a lack of documentation and very limited dating evidence.\n\nThe SKCL/SKCM design was modified numerous times by Alps over its lifetime. This process remains poorly understood, but a number of changes have been noted. Some of these points are expanded further under Design, below.\n\nTerminal sealant has been found in one instance.<ref>Deskthority — [Alps Appreciation](https://deskthority.net/keyboards-f2/alps-appreciation-t12915-1260.html#p352622) (post 352622)</ref>\n\n*   The original SKCL shell from ca. 1983 used longer, potentially more fragile tabs between the slits, and black switchplates\n*   When SKCM was introduced shortly afterwards, the new non-LED shell used shorter slits\n*   Around 1984 or so, the switchplate colour changed from black to grey\n*   Around 1989, all the slider colours changed, with the suggestion being that a newer, smoother plastic was used (this can be seen in the shinier sliders of switches from this point onwards and the lack of dry lubricant on switches from this period onwards); this was not a clean break, as [SKCM White](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCM_White \"Alps SKCM White\") continued to use dry lubricant briefly after it replaced [SKCM Blue](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCM_Blue \"Alps SKCM Blue\"),<ref name=\"DT-dry\\_lubricant\" /> and uncertainty remains as to which older switches correspond to which newer switches\n*   The 1989–1990 overhaul also saw the introduction of top branding on switches—using the newer Alps logo—and SKCL switches changed over to the shorter tabs between the slits when the shells were retooled (noticeable in comparison between typical SKCL Green and typical SKCL Yellow)\n*   Other changes during the 1989–1990 overhaul included switchplate alterations, first to colourless plastic, and then to a shorter version; as with the other changes, these occurred in a series of transitions\n*   Some switches around the end of the 80s had dark grey-blue upper shells instead of black; the timeframe for this remains uncertain, but SKCM Orange, White and Ivory are known to be amongst those affected\n*   Around 1993, the slits were removed entirely\n\n### Generations\n\n\\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series&veaction=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Generations\") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section's source code: Generations\")\\]\n\nVery broadly speaking, the series can be thought of as having three generations:\n\nFirst generation\n\n1983–1989; original colours, no top branding, long switchplates and dry lubricant applied to the sliders in at least some instances (first pine generation)\n\nSecond generation\n\n1989–1993; replacement colours, top branding, short switchplates and potentially a change in slider plastic to remove the need for dry lubricant (second pine generation)\n\nThird generation\n\n1993–1996; removal of slits (bamboo generation)\n\nThe changes to the switches between the first and second generations did not occur collectively but progressively; combinations different from the above exist from within the transition period. The specifics of the changes around 1993 that led to MouseFan rating them lower (\"bamboo\" vs \"pine\") are not well understood.\n\nDesign\n------\n\n\\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series&veaction=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Design\") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section's source code: Design\")\\]\n\nAlps SKCL/SKCM series is widely referred to as \"complicated Alps\", due to the design of the switch. SKCL switches have a fairly high count of 10 [parts per switch](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Parts_per_switch \"Parts per switch\"), and the click or tactile leaf of an SKCM switch brings this to 11. The complexity comes from the [switchplate](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Switchplate \"Switchplate\"), the assembly that contains the electrical contacts.\n\n*   [![A single Alps computer keyboard switch module](https://wiki.themk.org/images/thumb/b/b6/Alps_SKCM_Orange_--_side_view.jpg/499px-Alps_SKCM_Orange_--_side_view.jpg)](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Alps_SKCM_Orange_--_side_view.jpg \"A single Alps computer keyboard switch module\") A single Alps computer keyboard switch module \n*   [![Alps switch fitted into a keyboard mounting plate](https://wiki.themk.org/images/thumb/b/bc/Alps_SKCM_Salmon_--_infobox.jpg/499px-Alps_SKCM_Salmon_--_infobox.jpg)](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Alps_SKCM_Salmon_--_infobox.jpg \"Alps switch fitted into a keyboard mounting plate\") Alps switch fitted into a keyboard mounting plate \n*   [![Blue Alps switches; while the exact Alps design was rarely copied, Alps-inspired switches are frequently mistaken for real Alps switches](https://wiki.themk.org/images/thumb/8/88/Alps_SKCM_blue_complicated.jpg/500px-Alps_SKCM_blue_complicated.jpg)](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Alps_SKCM_blue_complicated.jpg \"Blue Alps switches; while the exact Alps design was rarely copied, Alps-inspired switches are frequently mistaken for real Alps switches\") Blue Alps switches; while the exact Alps design was rarely copied, Alps-inspired switches are frequently mistaken for real Alps switches \n*   [![In most Alps switches, the switchplate is at the rear of the switch with respect to the orientation of the logo and numbering](https://wiki.themk.org/images/thumb/8/83/Alps_SKCM_White_--_opened_switch.jpg/499px-Alps_SKCM_White_--_opened_switch.jpg)](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Alps_SKCM_White_--_opened_switch.jpg \"In most Alps switches, the switchplate is at the rear of the switch with respect to the orientation of the logo and numbering\") In most Alps switches, the switchplate is at the rear of the switch with respect to the orientation of the logo and numbering \n*   [![The switchplate that gives \"complicated\" Alps switches their complexity](https://wiki.themk.org/images/thumb/5/56/Alps_SKC_--_short_switchplate%2C_top.jpg/499px-Alps_SKC_--_short_switchplate%2C_top.jpg)](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Alps_SKC_--_short_switchplate,_top.jpg \"The switchplate that gives \\\"complicated\\\" Alps switches their complexity\") The [switchplate](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Switchplate \"Switchplate\") that gives \"complicated\" Alps switches their complexity \n*   [![Disassembled Alps SKCM White switch; SKCL/SKCM switches have a high number of constituent parts](https://wiki.themk.org/images/thumb/3/3a/Alps_SKCM_White_--_disassembled.jpg/499px-Alps_SKCM_White_--_disassembled.jpg)](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Alps_SKCM_White_--_disassembled.jpg \"Disassembled Alps SKCM White switch; SKCL/SKCM switches have a high number of constituent parts\") Disassembled [Alps SKCM White](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCM_White \"Alps SKCM White\") switch; SKCL/SKCM switches have a high number of constituent parts \n*   [![Diagram of Alps SKCL/SKCM switchplate](https://wiki.themk.org/images/thumb/a/a0/Alps_Diagram_1.png/500px-Alps_Diagram_1.png)](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Alps_Diagram_1.png \"Diagram of Alps SKCL/SKCM switchplate\") Diagram of Alps SKCL/SKCM switchplate \n*   [![Diagram of Alps SKCM with click leaf](https://wiki.themk.org/images/thumb/a/a9/Alps_Diagram_2.png/500px-Alps_Diagram_2.png)](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Alps_Diagram_2.png \"Diagram of Alps SKCM with click leaf\") Diagram of Alps SKCM with click leaf\n\n### Shell\n\n\\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series&veaction=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: Shell\") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section's source code: Shell\")\\]\n\nThe original design was a linear switch, with a hole in the upper shell to take an integrated LED. The tactile or click leaf needs to occupy this slot, making tactility and illumination mutually exclusive; this design limitation would become a problem with the [Matias Tactile Pro](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Matias_Tactile_Pro \"Matias Tactile Pro\") series, where customers mistook the necessarily linear LED key switches as manufacturing defects.\n\nAll standard linear switches have a recess for an LED. Surprisingly, most of these switches will not actually accept an LED, as there are no holes in the base for the LED legs. Separate part numbers existed for the LED versions, one per LED colour. The front securing tab for the shell also contains a clearance recess to provide room for the LED, which is also absent in the non-LED versions of linear switches. This clearance recess is subtle, but it is nonetheless visible in photographs of both yellow and green Alps switches.\n\n*   [![SKCLFQ (SKCLAR+red LED) and SKCLAR (no LED)](https://wiki.themk.org/images/thumb/5/5f/Alps_SKCLFQ_and_SKCLAR_--_top.jpg/499px-Alps_SKCLFQ_and_SKCLAR_--_top.jpg)](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Alps_SKCLFQ_and_SKCLAR_--_top.jpg \"SKCLFQ (SKCLAR+red LED) and SKCLAR (no LED)\") SKCLFQ (SKCLAR+red LED) and SKCLAR (no LED) \n*   [![SKCLFQ with adapted base design: note LED leg holes](https://wiki.themk.org/images/thumb/8/82/Alps_SKCLFQ_--_base_detail.jpg/499px-Alps_SKCLFQ_--_base_detail.jpg)](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Alps_SKCLFQ_--_base_detail.jpg \"SKCLFQ with adapted base design: note LED leg holes\") SKCLFQ with adapted base design: note LED leg holes \n*   [![Base comparison; note the clearance recess for the LED in the securing tab on the left switch (SKCLFQ)](https://wiki.themk.org/images/thumb/5/54/Alps_SKCLFQ_and_SKCLAR_--_bases.jpg/499px-Alps_SKCLFQ_and_SKCLAR_--_bases.jpg)](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Alps_SKCLFQ_and_SKCLAR_--_bases.jpg \"Base comparison; note the clearance recess for the LED in the securing tab on the left switch (SKCLFQ)\") Base comparison; note the clearance recess for the LED in the securing tab on the left switch (SKCLFQ)\n\nIn the 1980s, the whole switch shell was made of black plastic. At the very end the 80s, or the early 90s, the upper shell mouldings changed from black to dark grey. From this point onwards, switches would have two-tone grey-black shells, although they appear to have reverted to all-black again a while later.\n\nNot long after this point, the Alps logo was added to the upper shell, allowing switches made from that point onwards to be positively identified as Alps Electric products instead of [Alps clones](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_clone \"Alps clone\"). The exact weight of typeface of the Alps logo varied between mould, and later it would change to boldface text.\n\nThe lower shell has four \"wings\" that retain the switch against the mounting plate. These wings may snap off or become weakened, possibly when removing switches from keyboards.\n\n*   [![Alps SKCM Orange switch with two-tone shell](https://wiki.themk.org/images/thumb/8/8e/Alps_SKCM_Orange_--_rear_view.jpg/499px-Alps_SKCM_Orange_--_rear_view.jpg)](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Alps_SKCM_Orange_--_rear_view.jpg \"Alps SKCM Orange switch with two-tone shell\") [Alps SKCM Orange](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCM_Orange \"Alps SKCM Orange\") switch with two-tone shell \n*   [![Broken wings found at the bottom of a bag of yellow Alps switches](https://wiki.themk.org/images/thumb/d/dd/Alps_SKC_--_broken_wings.jpg/499px-Alps_SKC_--_broken_wings.jpg)](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Alps_SKC_--_broken_wings.jpg \"Broken wings found at the bottom of a bag of yellow Alps switches\") Broken wings found at the bottom of a bag of yellow Alps switches \n*   [![Alps SKCM Ivory switch with missing wings](https://wiki.themk.org/images/thumb/d/da/Alps_SKC_--_broken_wings_on_Cream_Damped.jpg/499px-Alps_SKC_--_broken_wings_on_Cream_Damped.jpg)](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Alps_SKC_--_broken_wings_on_Cream_Damped.jpg \"Alps SKCM Ivory switch with missing wings\") [Alps SKCM Ivory](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCM_Ivory \"Alps SKCM Ivory\") switch with missing wings\n\n### Slider\n\n\\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series&veaction=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: Slider\") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section's source code: Slider\")\\]\n\nThe [slider](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Slider \"Slider\") (Chinese and Japanese, \"軸\") is the moving connector between the keycap and [return spring](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Return_spring \"Return spring\"). The slider colour helps to identify the switch variant, in combination with other details such as the upper shell design.\n\nAlps sliders are horizontally symmetrical (the right side mirrors the left side), but in most cases they are not rotationally symmetrical: the back is not a mirror of the front, and the slider is not considered to be reversible. In particular, there is a small notch cut into the base at the rear; this side always faces the switchplate. The notched side also has a rounded edge, presumably to ensure smooth actuation and minimize [contact bounce](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Chatter \"Chatter\"). The front side of the slider has a sharp edge which minimizes drag against the tactile leaf. Because of this, reversing the slider will make the switch feel heavier and less crisp. This design was maintained with [Alps SKBL/SKBM series](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKBL/SKBM_series \"Alps SKBL/SKBM series\") \"simplified\" Alps, but no Alps clone switches are known to have copied this characteristic, as they all have reversible sliders.\n\n[Alps SKCL Green](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCL_Green \"Alps SKCL Green\") is an exception here in that the slider is reversible, has a longer spring support stem, and equally-sized small notches on both sides.

Following on from [Alps SKCC series](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCC_series \"Alps SKCC series\"), the original SKCL switches were linear. It appears that the first attempt at tactile feedback was the [Alps SKCM Brown](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCM_Brown \"Alps SKCM Brown\"); this was a skeleton switchplate designed to expand the tactility inherent in the actuator leaf design.\n\nThis was shortly followed by [Alps SKCM Blue](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCM_Blue \"Alps SKCM Blue\"), which introduced the idea of a folded leaf spring that is pulled away from the inside of the shell by the slider, and allowed to snap back into place to generate an audible sound. Blue Alps switches appeared around 1985, while the earliest [SMK second generation](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/SMK_second_generation \"SMK second generation\") switches have been found from 1986.\n\nThe click leaf concept was subsequently used in many switches, including SMK second generation switches and the [Omron B3G-S series](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Omron_B3G-S_series \"Omron B3G-S series\") as well as most [Alps clone](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_clone \"Alps clone\") switches, Alps derivatives, and Alps-SMK hybrid switches such as the [KPT switch](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/KPT_switch \"KPT switch\").\n\nThe progression of the tactile leaf is not clear; it may have been a derivative of the click leaf, or it may be that both designs were introduced at the same time, as [Alps SKCM Cream](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCM_Cream \"Alps SKCM Cream\"), which so far has been found to have a standard folded tactile leaf. The folded tactile leaf is similar to the click leaf, but two additional protrusions prevent it from being pulled forward, so it does not generate a click. The consequence of this design is that the tactility is not as strong as that generated by a click leaf. Tactile leaves often have a hole stamped in the centre; the reason for this is not known. It appears to have been absent in SKCM Cream, then present for [Alps SKCM Orange](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCM_Orange \"Alps SKCM Orange\") onwards, and removed again with [Alps SKCM White Damped](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCM_White_Damped \"Alps SKCM White Damped\").\n\n*   [![Original tactile leaf in SKCM Brown](https://wiki.themk.org/images/5/5e/Alps_CM_brown_--_tactile_assembly_1.jpg)](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Alps_CM_brown_--_tactile_assembly_1.jpg \"Original tactile leaf in SKCM Brown\") Original tactile leaf in SKCM Brown \n*   [![Click leaf in an Alps SKCM Amber switch](https://wiki.themk.org/images/thumb/5/5b/Alps_SKCM_Amber_--_click_leaf.jpg/499px-Alps_SKCM_Amber_--_click_leaf.jpg)](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Alps_SKCM_Amber_--_click_leaf.jpg \"Click leaf in an Alps SKCM Amber switch\") Click leaf in an [Alps SKCM Amber](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCM_Amber \"Alps SKCM Amber\") switch \n*   [![Click leaf (left) compared to tactile leaf (right); the designs of both changed over time](https://wiki.themk.org/images/thumb/7/72/Alps_SKCM_--_click_and_tactile_leaves%2C_front.jpg/499px-Alps_SKCM_--_click_and_tactile_leaves%2C_front.jpg)](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Alps_SKCM_--_click_and_tactile_leaves,_front.jpg \"Click leaf (left) compared to tactile leaf (right); the designs of both changed over time\") Click leaf (left) compared to tactile leaf (right); the designs of both changed over time \n*   [![Rear view of click and tactile leaves](https://wiki.themk.org/images/thumb/e/e0/Alps_SKCM_--_click_and_tactile_leaves%2C_rear.jpg/499px-Alps_SKCM_--_click_and_tactile_leaves%2C_rear.jpg)](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Alps_SKCM_--_click_and_tactile_leaves,_rear.jpg \"Rear view of click and tactile leaves\") Rear view of click and tactile leaves\n\n#### Modification\n\n\\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series&veaction=edit&section=8 \"Edit section: Modification\") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit section's source code: Modification\")\\]\n\nIt is possible to modify a tactile leaf spring to produce a click. This is done by bending down the two upper tabs, which allows the leaf to move within the slot in the upper housing. This affects both the feel and the sound of the switch.\n\n*   [![A stock tactile leaf from an Alps SKCM Ivory switch.](https://wiki.themk.org/images/thumb/a/af/Alps_SKCM_--_tactile_leaf_from_cream_damped_switch.jpg/498px-Alps_SKCM_--_tactile_leaf_from_cream_damped_switch.jpg)](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Alps_SKCM_--_tactile_leaf_from_cream_damped_switch.jpg \"A stock tactile leaf from an Alps SKCM Ivory switch.\") A stock tactile leaf from an Alps SKCM Ivory switch. \n*   [![A click-modified tactile leaf from an Alps SKCM Ivory switch.](https://wiki.themk.org/images/thumb/9/98/Alps_SKCM_--_click-modified_tactile_leaf_from_cream_damped_switch.jpg/498px-Alps_SKCM_--_click-modified_tactile_leaf_from_cream_damped_switch.jpg)](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Alps_SKCM_--_click-modified_tactile_leaf_from_cream_damped_switch.jpg \"A click-modified tactile leaf from an Alps SKCM Ivory switch.\") A click-modified tactile leaf from an Alps SKCM Ivory switch. \n*   [![A cutaway view inside an Alps SKCM Ivory switch.](https://wiki.themk.org/images/b/bc/Alps_SKCM_--_tactile_leaf_cross_section.gif)](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Alps_SKCM_--_tactile_leaf_cross_section.gif \"A cutaway view inside an Alps SKCM Ivory switch.\") A cutaway view inside an Alps SKCM Ivory switch. \n*   [![A cutaway view inside a click-modified Alps SKCM Ivory switch.](https://wiki.themk.org/images/2/2e/Alps_SKCM_--_click_leaf_cross_section.gif)](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Alps_SKCM_--_click_leaf_cross_section.gif \"A cutaway view inside a click-modified Alps SKCM Ivory switch.\") A cutaway view inside a click-modified Alps SKCM Ivory switch.\n\n### Switchplate\n\n\\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series&veaction=edit&section=9 \"Edit section: Switchplate\") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit section's source code: Switchplate\")\\]\n\nThe [switchplate](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Switchplate \"Switchplate\") is a six-part sandwich assembly containing the electrical switch contacts. It contains two terminals, with a flexible metal foil membrane placed against the first that is held apart from the second by a plastic separator. This assembly is held inside a plastic plate, above which a sprung actuator leaf is fitted. The slider bends the actuator leaf back against the plastic plate, where it presses a flap against the foil membrane, which is pressed against the rear terminal.\n\nThe plastic block initially extended down to the base of the shell; this is a known as a \"long\" switchplate. Later switches had this plastic block reduced in height, leaving a gap between it and the bottom of the shell; this is termed a \"short\" switchplate. There has been speculation that reducing the length of the switchplate degrades the smoothness of the switch, but this seems unlikely. Short switchplates are supported by two small posts adjacent to the holes for the legs.\n\nThe colour of the switchplate has also changed twice. Early switches used the black switchplates from [Alps SKCC series](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCC_series \"Alps SKCC series\") switches. The colour was soon changed to grey, with no other apparent change. Around 1987, the colour was changed again, to translucent white, which would be the final colour. The height was changed from long to short soon afterwards, around 1988.\n\nIn most switches, the switchplate is at the rear of the switch with respect to the orientation of the numbering and branding. [Alps SKCM White](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCM_White \"Alps SKCM White\") was an exception, with certain production runs having the branding orientated \"upside down\", seemingly randomly between the different moulds in the tooling. Alps clone switches frequently placed the contacts at the front of the switch instead, and simplified Alps switches appear to have reversed the orientation initially.\n\n*   [![Opened black Alps switch showing the shorter switchplate](https://wiki.themk.org/images/thumb/9/93/Black_Alps_CM_lower_shell_and_switchplate.jpg/499px-Black_Alps_CM_lower_shell_and_switchplate.jpg)](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Black_Alps_CM_lower_shell_and_switchplate.jpg \"Opened black Alps switch showing the shorter switchplate\") Opened black Alps switch showing the shorter switchplate \n*   [![Short and long white switchplates](https://wiki.themk.org/images/thumb/b/b4/Switchplate_--_Alps%2C_short_and_long.jpg/499px-Switchplate_--_Alps%2C_short_and_long.jpg)](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Switchplate_--_Alps,_short_and_long.jpg \"Short and long white switchplates\") Short and long white switchplates \n*   [![Rear view of short switchplate rear view](https://wiki.themk.org/images/thumb/b/b5/Alps_SKC_--_short_switchplate%2C_rear.jpg/499px-Alps_SKC_--_short_switchplate%2C_rear.jpg)](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Alps_SKC_--_short_switchplate,_rear.jpg \"Rear view of short switchplate rear view\") Rear view of short switchplate rear view \n*   [![Fully disassembled long white switchplate](https://wiki.themk.org/images/thumb/0/00/Alps_SKC_--_long_switchplate_parts%2C_top.jpg/499px-Alps_SKC_--_long_switchplate_parts%2C_top.jpg)](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Alps_SKC_--_long_switchplate_parts,_top.jpg \"Fully disassembled long white switchplate\") Fully disassembled long white switchplate\n\n### Latching action\n\n\\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series&veaction=edit&section=10 \"Edit section: Latching action\") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit section's source code: Latching action\")\\]\n\nMain article: [Alps SKCL Lock](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCL_Lock \"Alps SKCL Lock\") \n\nAs with so many other vintage switch families, the SKCL series includes a latching action switch. This replaced the LED or leaf area with a follower arm. This switch was produced in two separate slider colours (cream and grey) with no known distinction between them. Alps SKCL Lock was widely used in Apple keyboards for the [caps lock](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Caps_lock \"Caps lock\") key, as Apple used latching caps lock keys in all their keyboards for years; other Alps switch keyboard manufacturers were more likely to use integrated LED switches instead.\n\n*   [![Alps latching action design](https://wiki.themk.org/images/thumb/3/3e/Alps_lock_slider_in_open_position.jpg/499px-Alps_lock_slider_in_open_position.jpg)](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Alps_lock_slider_in_open_position.jpg \"Alps latching action design\") Alps latching action design \n*   [![Latch components](https://wiki.themk.org/images/thumb/a/a8/Alps_lock_upper_components.jpg/499px-Alps_lock_upper_components.jpg)](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Alps_lock_upper_components.jpg \"Latch components\") Latch components\n\n### Slits\n\n\\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series&veaction=edit&section=11 \"Edit section: Slits\") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit section's source code: Slits\")\\]\n\nOn switches made up to 1993, the slider aperture contained a pair of prongs, one per side, possibly designed to dampen the impact of the return stroke. The resulting appearance of a switch shell with these prongs is described as \"having slits\", one above and one below each prong. These prongs, and thereby the slits, disappeared around 1993. MouseFan in particular considers the switch quality to have degraded around the time that the slits disappeared.<ref name=\"MouseFan\" />\n\nBased on MouseFan's terminology, switches with slits can be referred to as \"pine\" (「松」, *matsu*) and switches without slits as \"bamboo\" (「竹」, *take*) based on the Japanese three-tier grading system, with pine as the highest grade.<ref name=\"Digi\\_Joho\" />\n\n[File:Alps SKCL-SKCM -- slits.svg](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Special:Upload&wpDestFile=Alps_SKCL-SKCM_--_slits.svg \"File:Alps SKCL-SKCM -- slits.svg\")\n\nThe length of the tabs enclosed by the slits also changed with time; the tabs, and thereby the slits, had reduced in length after a couple of years. The longer tabs were potentially more prone to damage when pulling keycaps, as the tabs bear the strong keycap removal force by holding the slider down.\n\n*   [![Typical SKCL Green, with longer tabs](https://wiki.themk.org/images/thumb/d/d1/Alps_SKCL_Green_--_variants_table.jpg/499px-Alps_SKCL_Green_--_variants_table.jpg)](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Alps_SKCL_Green_--_variants_table.jpg \"Typical SKCL Green, with longer tabs\") Typical SKCL Green, with longer tabs \n*   [![SKCL Yellow, with shorter tabs](https://wiki.themk.org/images/thumb/6/66/Alps_SKCL_Yellow_--_variants_table.jpg/499px-Alps_SKCL_Yellow_--_variants_table.jpg)](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Alps_SKCL_Yellow_--_variants_table.jpg \"SKCL Yellow, with shorter tabs\") SKCL Yellow, with shorter tabs\n\n### Logo\n\n\\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series&veaction=edit&section=12 \"Edit section: Logo\") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit section's source code: Logo\")\\]\n\nEarly Alps SKCL/SKCM switches only bore the Alps logo on the bottom, where it could not be seen without removing the switch from the keyboard. Around 1988, Alps added their new-style logo the top of each switch, just after [Alps SKCM White](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCM_White \"Alps SKCM White\") was introduced. At least two variants of this logo can be found, as Alps broadened the strokes of the letters.\n\nThe lack of visible branding on older Alps switches is one of the aspects of confusion between genuine Alps parts and [clone](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_clone \"Alps clone\") switches, as most clone switches are completely unbranded.\n\nSimplified Alps\n---------------\n\n\\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series&veaction=edit&section=13 \"Edit section: Simplified Alps\") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit section's source code: Simplified Alps\")\\]\n\nMain article: [Alps SKBL/SKBM series](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKBL/SKBM_series \"Alps SKBL/SKBM series\") \n\nSimplified Alps switches seem to have first appeared around 1996.<ref name=\"MouseFan\" /> Simplified Alps was a redesign of the switch to remove the complexity of the switchplate system.

If the switch has four small tabs (a so-called \"[four-tab clone](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Four-tab_clone \"Four-tab clone\")\"), it is certainly a clone. If the switch has two long side tabs, it is relatively likely to be genuine Alps (especially if the board dates back to the 1980s), but there are copies of the switch with long tabs.\n\n*   [Two long tabs: quite possibly Alps SKCL/SKCM/SKBL/SKBM](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Special:Upload&wpDestFile=Switch_recognition--Alps--Original.svg \"File:Switch recognition--Alps--Original.svg\") **Two long tabs:**\n    quite possibly Alps SKCL/SKCM/SKBL/SKBM \n*   [Four small tabs: guaranteed to be a clone or derivative](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Special:Upload&wpDestFile=Switch_recognition--Alps--Four_tab_clone.svg \"File:Switch recognition--Alps--Four tab clone.svg\") **Four small tabs:**\n    guaranteed to be a [clone](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_clone \"Alps clone\") or derivative\n\nKorean switches\n---------------\n\n\\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series&veaction=edit&section=15 \"Edit section: Korean switches\") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series&action=edit&section=15 \"Edit section's source code: Korean switches\")\\]\n\nSome Alps keyboards were made by the Gold Star–Alps joint venture company Gold Star Alps in Korea. Uncertainty surrounds production from this company. There are three switch types that appear to be specific to Korea: [Alps SKCL Brown](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCL_Brown \"Alps SKCL Brown\") (replacing green), [Alps SKCL Amber](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCL_Amber \"Alps SKCL Amber\") (replacing cream), and a brown version of [Alps SKCL Lock](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCL_Lock \"Alps SKCL Lock\") (which if it were to follow Japanese colour convention would be amber to match the heavier momentary switch). Keyboards made by Gold Star Alps have been found with [Alps keyboard codes](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_keyboard_codes \"Alps keyboard codes\") ending with an extra letter \"K\", while one of the keyboards with SKCL Brown switches (a Visual Technology terminal keyboard) of unknown manufacture also has a PCB code ending \"K\". Details of Leading Edge keyboards is scarce, but a [Leading Edge DC-3014](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Leading_Edge_DC-3014 \"Leading Edge DC-3014\") has been found with SKCL Brown (tying in with Leading Edge being owned by Korean manufacturer Daewoo), while photos of a blue Alps [DC-2014](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Leading_Edge_DC-2014 \"Leading Edge DC-2014\") show a PCB code without the final 'K'.\n\nThere may not be a direct correspondence between the \"K\" suffix and Korea, but there is evidence to suggest that Korean production of linear switches used different pigment. Click switches assumed to have been made in Korea were however the normal blue colour. More keyboard examples are required to strengthen or disprove this theory.\n\nVariants\n--------\n\n\\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series&veaction=edit&section=16 \"Edit section: Variants\") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series&action=edit&section=16 \"Edit section's source code: Variants\")\\]\n\nOfficial information on Alps keyboard switches is extremely scarce. The years in the table below are mostly the result of observations by MouseFan,<ref name=\"MouseFan\" /> and only indicate the earliest and latest known instances of the switches in question. Many of the part numbers were obtained by Sandy from a paper copy of the 1994 Alps catalogue that circulated in the Japanese keyboard community, of which the original version and the scanned PDF are now lost. Specific information relating to each switch can be found on its respective page.\n\nIn some instances, heavier weight switches have been marked with black paint across the top of the slider, instead of a separate plastic colour.<ref name=\"MouseFan\\_8801\" /><ref name=\"DT\\_greenteardown\" />\n\nThe switches all have a basic six-letter model, of which the first four letters are either \"SKCL\" (linear) or \"SKCM\" (tactile, including clicky). Two further letters identify the model of switch; the first letter provides categorisation, such as undamped (A) vs damped (B), or LED (F) vs no LED (A). Additional numbers and letters are appended to provide the specific part number, presumably to indicate revisions in the design; their meaning is not understood. Some model numbers have been obtained and are listed in the table below; most part numbers remain unknown.\n\nA useful mnemonic for dealing with Alps part numbers, is \"**L**\" for \"linear\" (SKCL and SKBL), and to imagine that the \"**C**\" in SKCL/SKCM stands for \"complicated\" (and possibly \"**B**\" for \"basic\" in SKBL/SKBM).\n\nSwitch\n\nType\n\nKey feel\n\nForce\n\nYears

en masse for nearly two decades so they are quite common. The switches are maintenance-free if used in a clean environment.\n\nUnfortunately, the relatively open design of these switches (particularly the \"pine\" variant with slits) and the relatively large area of tight tolerance between the switch sliders and the switch top housing, makes the Alps SKCL/SKCM series switches particularly prone to dirt incursion.\n\nDirty Alps switches will feel scratchy, sluggish, and uneven. By comparison, new or well maintained switches should feel light, crisp, and precise.\n\nAfter some experimentation, Deskthority user XMIT has found that **with a good thorough cleaning of the sliders and switch tops, and a shot of compressed air in the bottoms and the switch plates, even the dirtiest of switches can feel like new,** so long as the springs or switch plates are not rusted. An ultrasonic cleaner is recommended for cleaning the switch tops and the switch sliders. Ultrasonic cleaning is not recommended or generally necessary for the switch housing bottoms, switch plates, springs, or leaves.\n\nLubrication does not improve the feel of a thoroughly cleaned switch by much. Both XMIT and Hypersphere on Deskthority have had good experience with an extremely light coating of Super Lube Oil with PTFE, a synthetic oil with Teflon particles in suspension, on the switch sliders and the slider guides on the switch top housings.\n\n*   [Here](https://deskthority.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=23878) is an article claiming to have found a similar lubricant to the one used on the earliest versions of SKCL/SKCM switches.\n\nExternal links\n--------------\n\n\\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series&veaction=edit&section=20 \"Edit section: External links\") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series&action=edit&section=20 \"Edit section's source code: External links\")\\]\n\n*   [Ripster Guide: Taking apart ALPS switches](http://imgur.com/a/elAFF) Dated 2012.
