Like many of their other switches, Alps buckling spring switches take [Alps mount](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_mount \"Alps mount\")[keycaps](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Keycap \"Keycap\").\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\n\\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_buckling_spring&veaction=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Description\") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_buckling_spring&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section's source code: Description\")\\]\n\nThis mechanism was patented by Alps in 1989 as the **\"Push button switch with actuator for applying transverse force to buckling spring\"**<ref name=\"patent\" />, with Takafumi Kato as the inventor. It is commonly associated with the keyboard of the [IBM](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/IBM \"IBM\")\\-designed Sega TeraDrive, although it was used in some non-IBM keyboards such as certain [C. Itoh](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=C._Itoh&action=edit&redlink=1 \"C. Itoh (page does not exist)\") terminal keyboards. It is unknown if it was developed by request of IBM, or whether it developed under Alps's own initiative, and later picked by IBM for the Sega TeraDrive design.\n\n[![](https://wiki.themk.org/images/d/d2/Fig5ALps.jpg)](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Fig5ALps.jpg)\n\nDiagram from Alps patent showing hammer with follower\n\nAccording to the patent, the switch was designed to have a lower profile than other buckling spring implementations. As with IBM membrane and Brother designs, Alps buckling spring is a hammer-over-membrane design. However, it differs in that the pivoting hammer has a follower behind the spring which pushes the spring forward during travel. The patent describes this modification as being necessary in a compact buckling spring switch to ensure that a short spring will buckle forward properly. It also noted that a regular buckling spring mechanism needed springs manufactured to very specific tolerances for the spring to buckle properly, which might imply that assisting the buckling of the spring with a follower would allow cheaper springs to be used. This switch uses a shorter spring than other buckling spring implementations, and has notably less key travel. It also has lower force requirements than other buckling spring switches. However, it has been described as a less satisfying switch to type on compared with the more conventional buckling spring mechanisms.\n\nUnusually for a buckling spring mechanism, there is a [slider](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Slider \"Slider\") over the spring. This slider is compatible with standard Alps keycaps as used with the [Alps SKCL/SKCM series](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series \"Alps SKCL/SKCM series\") and [Plate Spring](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_plate_spring \"Alps plate spring\") switch designs.\n\nKeyboards\n---------\n\n\\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_buckling_spring&veaction=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Keyboards\") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_buckling_spring&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section's source code: Keyboards\")\\]\n\n*   [Alps SM-101](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SM-101 \"Alps SM-101\")<ref name=\"DT-HTR-2106\" />\n*   C.ITOH CIT324/324E<ref name=\"MouseFan-C.Itoh\" />\n*   [Sega HTR-2106](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Sega_HTR-2106 \"Sega HTR-2106\")\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n\\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_buckling_spring&veaction=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: References\") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_buckling_spring&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section's source code: References\")\\]\n\n<references> <ref name=\"patent\">[US Patent 5010219](https://www.google.com/patents/US5010219), Takafumi Kato, \"Push button switch with actuator for applying transverse force to buckling spring\", filed Jul 7 1989, issued Apr 23 1991.</ref> <ref name=\"DT-HTR-2106\">Deskthority — [The Sega HTR-2106 - Sega + IBM + Alps](http://deskthority.net/photos-videos-f8/the-sega-htr-2106-sega-ibm-alps-t62.html)</ref> <ref name=\"MouseFan-C.Itoh\">MouseFan — [C.ITOH 2種](http://mousefan.telcontar.net/image/citoh.htm)</ref> </references>\n\nRetrieved from \"[https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps\\_buckling\\_spring&oldid=43150](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_buckling_spring&oldid=43150)\"\n\n[Categories](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Special:Categories \"Special:Categories\"):\n\n*   [Pages requiring illustration](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Category:Pages_requiring_illustration \"Category:Pages requiring illustration\")\n*   [Alps switches](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Category:Alps_switches \"Category:Alps switches\")\n*   [Clicky switches](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Category:Clicky_switches \"Category:Clicky switches\")\n*   [Membrane switches](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Category:Membrane_switches \"Category:Membrane switches\")\n*   [Buckling spring switches](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Category:Buckling_spring_switches \"Category:Buckling spring switches\")\n*   [List of all keyboard switches](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Category:List_of_all_keyboard_switches \"Category:List of all keyboard switches\")\n\nNavigation menu\n---------------\n\n### Page actions\n\n*   [Page](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_buckling_spring \"View the content page [alt-shift-c]\")\n*   [Discussion](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Talk:Alps_buckling_spring&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Discussion about the content page (page does not exist) [alt-shift-t]\")\n*   [Read](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_buckling_spring)\n*   [Edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_buckling_spring&veaction=edit \"Edit this page [alt-shift-v]\")\n*   [Edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_buckling_spring&action=edit \"Edit the source code of this page [alt-shift-e]\")\n*   [History](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_buckling_spring&action=history \"Past revisions of this page [alt-shift-h]\")\n\n### Page actions\n\n*   [Page](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_buckling_spring \"Page\")\n*   [Discussion](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Talk:Alps_buckling_spring&action=edit&redlink=1 \" (page does not exist)\")\n*   [More](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_buckling_spring#p-cactions)\n*   [Tools](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_buckling_spring#p-tb \"Tools\")\n\n### Personal tools\n\n*   Not logged in\n*   [Talk](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Special:MyTalk \"Discussion about edits from this IP address [alt-shift-n]\")\n*   [Contributions](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Special:MyContributions \"A list of edits made from this IP address [alt-shift-y]\")\n*   [Create account](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Special:CreateAccount&returnto=Alps+buckling+spring \"You are encouraged to create an account and log in; however, it is not mandatory\")\n*   [Log in](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Alps+buckling+spring \"You are encouraged to log in; however, it is not mandatory [alt-shift-o]\")\n\n[](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Main_Page) [](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_buckling_spring#sidebar \"Jump to navigation\")[](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_buckling_spring#p-personal \"user tools\")[](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_buckling_spring#globalWrapper \"back to top\")",
