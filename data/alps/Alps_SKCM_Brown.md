**Alps SKCM Brown**, or **tactile Brown Alps**, is a tactile switch in the complicated [Alps SKCL/SKCM series](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series "Alps SKCL/SKCM series").

Tactile Brown Alps is the original tactile switch in the SKCM series. Tactility was introduced by placing a second, modified switchplate actuator leaf onto a dummy block on the opposite side of the switch. This arrangement has been reported to have a superior feel to the later design.\[Citation needed\] Tactile Brown Alps has also been found with standard tactile leaves.<ref name="KBDMania-Brown" />

The feel of tactile Brown Alps has been reported to be similar to the officially documented force curve of [Alps SKCM Green](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCM_Green "Alps SKCM Green") switches, which have a tactile leaf of a shape quite close to that of tactile Brown Alps.<ref name="GH-JD-2" /> It is possible therefore that tactile Green is the successor to tactile Brown.

[Linear Brown Alps](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCL_Brown "Alps SKCL Brown") switches also exist; these can be identified by an LED cutout in the upper shell.
