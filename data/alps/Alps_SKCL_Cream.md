As with the other linear switches, Alps SKCL Cream has an LED recess which occupies the position where the tactile or click leaf would otherwise go. Typically this recess is left empty.

Alps SKCL Cream is a fairly uncommon linear Alps switch. They are reported to be slightly heavier than [Alps SKCL Yellow](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCL_Yellow "Alps SKCL Yellow"), and while they have been used as a space bar switch by Zenith, they were also considered light enough to be used as standard keyboard switches.<ref name="gh-Bondwell" />

The [Zenith ZKB-2](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Zenith_ZKB-2 "Zenith ZKB-2") used both Alps SKCL Cream (found in a 1989 keyboard) and [Alps SKCL Grey](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCL_Grey "Alps SKCL Grey") (found in a 1990 keyboard) for the space bar. [Alps SKCL Green](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCL_Green "Alps SKCL Green") variants of the ZKB-2 use SKCL Cream while [Alps SKCL Yellow](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCL_Yellow "Alps SKCL Yellow") variants use [Alps SKCL Grey](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCL_Grey "Alps SKCL Grey").
