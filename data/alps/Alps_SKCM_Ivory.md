**Alps SKCM Ivory**, or damped tactile Cream Alps / Damped Cream Alps (colloquially), is a [damped](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Damping "Damping") tactile switch in the [Alps SKCL/SKCM series](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series "Alps SKCL/SKCM series"). It should not be mistaken for the earlier [Alps SKCM Cream](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCM_Cream "Alps SKCM Cream"), which was not damped. If the switch has no Alps logo on the top then it is likely to be the latter.

\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKCM_Ivory&veaction=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Description") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKCM_Ivory&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section's source code: Description")\]

Ivory Alps switches have small black rubber dampers fitted into grooves on either side of the slider; these quieten the switch by cushioning the impact of the slider against the inside of the switch both when bottoming out and on its return. The damper does not reach to the bottom of the slider, so the stops moulded into the base of the shell have been widened to accommodate.

Variants of the switch exist both with slits and without, with slits being the significantly more common variety. The model was followed by [SKCM White Damped](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCM_White_Damped "Alps SKCM White Damped"), which differs in that the sliders are made from a different plastic and the switch weighting is slightly heavier, though is otherwise identical to Ivory without slits.

It appears that the tactile leaf was modified during its production run, with the hole removed, and small indentations introduced. Initally, they used either very similar, or exacly the same tactile leaves as [Alps SKCM Salmon](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCM_Salmon "Alps SKCM Salmon"). They were replaced later by the kind most commonly found in [Alps SKCM Black](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCM_Black "Alps SKCM Black") and [Alps SKCM White Damped](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCM_White_Damped "Alps SKCM White Damped") switches.

Early switches were lubricated.
