By the Deskthority definition of a [clone](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Clone "Clone") switch, **Alps clone** refers to a keyboard switch, not made by [Alps Electric](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_Electric "Alps Electric"), that is interchangeable with [Alps SKCL/SKCM series](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series "Alps SKCL/SKCM series") and [SKBL/SKBM series](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKBL/SKBM_series "Alps SKBL/SKBM series") switches. Such switches must match Alps's switches as follows:

*   Pin layout — switch can be soldered onto an Alps PCB
*   Dimensions of housing — switch should snap into an Alps mounting plate and switch should accept the same distance between the PCB and plate
*   [Alps mount](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_mount "Alps mount") slider — switch should take keycaps from Alps switches

Because many switches are superficially similar to Alps SKCL/SKCM and SKBL/SKBM series switches, and because earlier SKCL/SKCM switches were not visibly branded (the branding was only on the bottom, which faces the PCB), it became common to mistake a wide variety of switches for being "Alps" switches, including Alps clones and the [Acer switch](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Acer_switch "Acer switch").

### Exterior

Alps switches have a very recognisable design, that has rarely been copied, that allows them to be fairly positively identified even when not branded.

Switches that are merely keycap-compatible with Alps are in simply classified as [keyboard switches with Alps mount](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Category:Keyboard_switches_with_Alps_mount "Category:Keyboard switches with Alps mount").

### Internals

\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_clone&veaction=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Internals") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_clone&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section's source code: Internals")\]

Alps clone switches are internally very different to SKCL/SKCM series. Alps SKCL/SKCM as well as [SKCC series](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCC_series "Alps SKCC series") use a self-contained contact assembly, a "[switchplate](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Switchplate "Switchplate")". While similar constructions exist in products from other prominent brands such as Omron, Mitsumi and Hosiden, Alps clone switches and other switches derived from Alps, SMK and Omron types typically use simple switch contacts that are secured by grooves in the shell.
