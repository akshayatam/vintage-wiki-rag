**Alps SKBL Yellow** is a linear switch in the simplified [Alps SKBL/SKBM series](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKBL/SKBM_series "Alps SKBL/SKBM series"). In contrast to complicated Alps switches, the specification for SKBLFE depicts it without an LED recess. The yellow slider colour is described in the specification. It might be reasonable to assume that Forward offered no comparable product to [Alps SKCL Yellow](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCL_Yellow "Alps SKCL Yellow"), otherwise Matias keyboards would not have needed Xiang Min switches for the keys with integrated LEDs.

As with all [Alps SKBL/SKBM series](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKBL/SKBM_series "Alps SKBL/SKBM series") switches, SKBL Yellow uses the simplified contact mechanism. The slider is a pale yellow, with a black top and bottom housing. Conforming to the specification sheet, it has no LED cutout unlike [Alps SKCL Yellow](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCL_Yellow "Alps SKCL Yellow") or [Alps SKCL Green](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCL_Green "Alps SKCL Green"). The spring is about 12mm long, which is longer than that of complicated Alps switches.

The weighting on the specification sheet appears to be inaccurate as the actual force appears to be much lower than 60gf. However, this is unconfirmed and based purely on speculation.

This switch has not knowingly been sighted in a keyboard. However, loose switches have been sighted.
