The slider colour is very pale yellow, not much darker than cream.

The latch track in the slider is followed by a miniature brass pin. The pin is placed through a hole in a flat plastic block, and this block is free to move laterally within a groove inside the switch. The pin is able to move front to back to travel over the ramps in the latch track, and a leaf spring placed vertically behind the sliding block appears to apply pressure to the pin.

The latch mechanism occupies the space that is otherwise reserved for the LED (inside the switch) or [NKRO](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Rollover,_blocking_and_ghosting "Rollover, blocking and ghosting") diode (in the space below the rear of a regular SKFL switch).
