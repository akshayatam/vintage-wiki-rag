Alps "Bigfoot" keyboards were sold to a large number of customers; in Japan, they are best known for their use in AX systems, and in the West they are best known in the guise of the original [Dell AT101](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Dell_AT101 "Dell AT101"). The "Bigfoot" name has also become associated with the [Alps SKCL/SKCM series](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series "Alps SKCL/SKCM series") switches used in these keyboards.

The [Packard Bell KCLEA907L](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Packard_Bell_KCLEA907L&action=edit&redlink=1 "Packard Bell KCLEA907L (page does not exist)") has a case of the same design, but the switch layout is based on the [IBM Model F](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/IBM_Model_F "IBM Model F") AT, instead of the [IBM Model M](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/IBM_Model_M "IBM Model M").<ref name="rzwv-GoldStar" /> This smaller design is not covered by the "Bigfoot" moniker.

Later Dell AT101 keyboards, as well as at the AT101W and AT102W, were made by [Silitek](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Silitek "Silitek"), with an identical design to the Alps-made keyboards; it is not known whether this transfer of manufacturing was amicable, or whether it was arranged without the participation and approval of Alps Electric.

Identity
--------

\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_Bigfoot&veaction=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Identity") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_Bigfoot&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section's source code: Identity")\]

In the 1994 Alps catalogue, Bigfoot keyboards were listed as models KFCMEA and KFCLEA. The model numbers suggest separate product ranges for linear (SKCL) and tactile and clicky (SKCM) switches. "KFCLEA" has an extra 'F' compared to the "KCLEA907L" Packard Bell model. The non-Bigfoot [Panasonic Business Partner 286](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Panasonic_Business_Partner_286 "Panasonic Business Partner 286") keyboard has assembly number KFCMEA015A, which suggests that "KFCLEA" and "KFCMEA" refer simply to SKCL/SKCM series switches and do not denote any specific keyboard arrangement.

Rear labels do not use KF codes. Generic OEM labels as found on Dell and Toshiba keyboards refer to these keyboards as models "101"<ref name="at101-102" /> and "102"<ref name="dt-toshiba102" /> and as "AT101" (and presumably AT102) from family "AT101-102".<ref name="at101-102" /> "101" and "AT101" appear in the Alps Electric USA FCC IDs of GYI3PVAT101 and GYIAT101-102 (keyboards made in the US and Ireland). Whether this has any bearing on Alps Electric in Japan is not known.
