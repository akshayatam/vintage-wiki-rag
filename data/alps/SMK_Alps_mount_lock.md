**SMK Alps mount lock** is the [alternate action](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alternate_action "Alternate action") switch in the SMK second generation series.

Description
-----------

\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=SMK_Alps_mount_lock&veaction=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Description") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=SMK_Alps_mount_lock&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section's source code: Description")\]

The operation is very similar to that of [SMK lock](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/SMK_lock "SMK lock"), where a swivelling pin follows a track. Where the J-M0404 series version used an external module to house the pin and a track on the slider, the second generation design reverses this: the track is in a separate block, and the pin fits into the slider. The position of the track block inside the switch explains why the left-hand retention clip is offset to the back of the switch.

The pressure spring that supports the follower pin is small, at 4 mm long and 1.38 mm in diameter; this is larger than the equivalent spring in [RAFI full-travel key switch](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/RAFI_full-travel_key_switch "RAFI full-travel key switch"), which in RS 74 M is a mere 2.7 mm long.
