It is not clear whether SKCL Heavy Grey is a catalogue switch or a custom production run for a specific NEC keyboard or set of NEC keyboards; the only known keyboard to date was made in 1992. It has been measured using coin stacking as 120 g, twice the weight of the yellow linear switches in the same keyboard, which came out as 60 g. The LED recess is present as with other SKCL switches.
