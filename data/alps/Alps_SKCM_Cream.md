Description

\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKCM_Cream&veaction=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Description") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKCM_Cream&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section's source code: Description")\]

SKCM Cream is an [undamped](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Damping "Damping") switch, and should not be confused with the more common [Alps SKCM Cream Damped](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCM_Cream_Damped "Alps SKCM Cream Damped") tactile switch. SKCM Cream switches have a much lighter colored slider. They are most commonly found in NeXT Non-ADB keyboards with the smaller non L enter.

SKCM Creams found in Canon Typewriters have been reported to be heavier. However other enthusiasts, who have had both NeXT non-ADB keyboard and canon typewriters in their collections, disapprove this statement, claiming that SKCM Cream in both are identical. Thus, in order for the previous statement regarding the weight of SKCM Cream switches in different input devices to hold true, further testing (i.e. measuring force) needs to be carried out.

It has been reported that there are 2 types of SKCM Creams, with the difference being in the number of tabs the tactile leaf contains (2-tab vs. 4-tab)<ref name="twocreams" />. The 2-tab versions have been found in some [Canon typewriters](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Canon_typewriters "Canon typewriters").
