A number of details on [Alps switches](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Category:Alps_switches "Category:Alps switches") come from a 1994 Alps catalogue that was circulated amongst Japanese keyboard enthusiasts, obtained around 2004 or 2005. The original catalogue was in colour, and was scanned to PDF. Black and white photostat copies were also made and passed to various people. The original catalogue and the PDF document are considered lost, as are all photocopies besides Sandy's, which is the only copy known to remain.

The catalogue is known to cover the following switches:

SKCL

SKCLAR, SKCLAQ, SKCLJC, SKCLFQ, SKCLFM, SKCLBB

SKCM

SKCMAP, SKCMAQ, SKCMAT, SKCMBB

SKFR

SKFRAC, SKFRAD, SKFRFA, SKFRFB, SKFRFC

SKFS

SKFSAA

The owner of the catalogue asked [Alps Electric](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_Electric "Alps Electric") for permission to republish it, and was denied. Photos provided from Sandy depicting parts of pages (but not whole pages) were posted to Deskthority and Geekhack before Alps's prior restriction was noted.

The SKCL/SKCM part numbers come from Sandy's transcript. SKFR/SKFS part numbers likely also came from Sandy; currently the only confirmed details are in an archive of geekhack wiki, which itself cited this same catalogue.<ref name="gh-Alps">Geekhack — [Default:ALPS switches](http://archive.today/45sFi) (archive) Archived 2014-01-12.

Sandy provided the following notes in November 2013 (taken from a plain text e-mail). Whether they are verbatim or summarised is not known, and none of the explanatory text should be considered official Alps information without clarification.

It is interesting to note that the two series are given as "CL series" and "CM series" instead of "SKCL" and "SKCM", which partially corresponds with the catalogue fragment (from an older catalogue) that identified [Alps SKCM Cream](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCM_Cream "Alps SKCM Cream") (SKCMAF) and [Alps SKCM Blue](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCM_Blue "Alps SKCM Blue") (SKCMAG). Although "SKCL/SLCM series" was used in an official Alps document, this may indicate a terminology revision. (The text below is given verbatim, including typing mistakes and transcription errors. For example, "SLCLAQ" should read "SKCLAQ")

CL series ( All Linear) SKCLAR; Yellow, 0.588N SLCLAQ; Grey, 0.882N ( maybe be same one with space bar sw in Zenith ZKB-2 SKCLJC; Grey, 1.47N, Altenate type( referred as ALPS CM lock in deskthority ) SKCLFQ; Yellow with Red LED SKCLFM; Yellow with Green LED SKCLBB; White, Double action CM series. Operating force;0.686N(70gf) SKCMAP; Black, Without tactile sound SKCMAQ; White, With tactile sound SKCMAT; Green, Without tactile sound ( I haven't seen this one ) SKCMBB; Ivory, Quiet ( I suppose this one indicates rubber dumped sw used in SG AT-101. Dumped White ( in Apple EX-II) is not listed. \*\* Switching position and operating force diagram shows SKCMAT is quite different \*\* from others. operating force diagram is close to that of menbrane switch. CM compact is not listed in '94 catalog.
