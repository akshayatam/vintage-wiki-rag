**Alps SKCM Black**, or tactile complicated **Black Alps**, is a tactile switch in the [Alps SKCL/SKCM series](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series "Alps SKCL/SKCM series"). Complicated Black Alps are well-known for its use in the [Dell AT101](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Dell_AT101 "Dell AT101") series of keyboards.

Opinions on SKCM Black Alps switch vary. Early iterations of the switch seemingly use the same tactile leaf as the SKCM Salmon switches, with the difference being the lack of the hole in the leafspring. Later versions replaced the tactile leaf with the newer, seemingly sharper one found in the later version of [SKCM Cream Damped](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCM_Cream_Damped "Alps SKCM Cream Damped"), and [SKCM White Damped](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCM_White_Damped "Alps SKCM White Damped") switches. With the newer tactile leaf the force curve is unclean,<ref name="Silencium" /> lending the switch a rough feel that leads many to pan the switch.

Early pine switches are reported to have lubricant on the sliders.
