Monterey switches and keycap

**SMK Alps mount switch** is a provisional name for the [Alps mount](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_mount "Alps mount") variant of the [SMK second generation](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/SMK_second_generation "SMK second generation") family. The most common variety is the clicky variant with the blue slider, widely referred to as a **Monterey switch**; the popular moniker "Monterey" owes its origin to the switch being discovered in a [Monterey K104](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Monterey_K104 "Monterey K104") keyboard, and the choice of name is attributed to Japanese keyboard collector MouseFan.<ref name="MouseFan-name" /> The tactile variety was used in the [Apple Desktop Bus Keyboard](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Apple_Desktop_Bus_Keyboard "Apple Desktop Bus Keyboard"), suggesting an introduction date of 1986 or earlier.

Description
-----------

\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=SMK_Alps_mount&veaction=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Description") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=SMK_Alps_mount&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section's source code: Description")\]

The keycaps are compatible with [Alps SKCL/SKCM series](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series "Alps SKCL/SKCM series") switches, but the switch has a different mounting hole and pin layout. A coiled spring provides most of the resistance, and there are two leaf springs for contact and [click](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Click_leaf "Click leaf")/tactility respectively.

This is the only SMK second generation switch to lack [fixing pins](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Fixing_pins "Fixing pins"), making it plate mount only.

The switch's feel has made it well regarded among keyboard enthusiasts.

Authenticity
------------

\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=SMK_Alps_mount&veaction=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Authenticity") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=SMK_Alps_mount&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section's source code: Authenticity")\]

Unlike other switches in this family, the base of the Alps-mount switches are not SMK branded; this led many people to believe the switch to be a copy.

The Apple IIGS Technical Procedures confirm that the tactile version in the [Apple Desktop Bus Keyboard](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Apple_Desktop_Bus_Keyboard "Apple Desktop Bus Keyboard") is SMK.<ref name="A2GSTP" /> Both [Monterey](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Monterey "Monterey") and [Chicony](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Chicony "Chicony") have confirmed purchasing these switches from SMK.<ref name="C-Monterey" /><ref name="C-Chicony" /> No reason for the lack of branding is known, although another difference with this variant is the lack of PCB fixing pins. A diode symbol on the base of the branded [Cherry MX mount variant](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/SMK_Cherry_MX_mount "SMK Cherry MX mount") (which lacks support for diodes) indicates that design errors did occur when retooling.

Key feel
--------

\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=SMK_Alps_mount&veaction=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Key feel") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=SMK_Alps_mount&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section's source code: Key feel")\]

The switch has a tactile bump just before actuation where it also clicks. It actuates near 2 mm into the stroke and bottoms out at 3.6 mm. It feels a lot like a [Cherry MX Blue](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Cherry_MX_Blue "Cherry MX Blue") switch but with sharper tactility. Unlike the Cherry MX Blue, it does not have [hysteresis](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Hysteresis "Hysteresis").

### Comparison with inverse cross mount

\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=SMK_Alps_mount&veaction=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Comparison with inverse cross mount") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=SMK_Alps_mount&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section's source code: Comparison with inverse cross mount")\]

The inverse cross and Alps mount variants are broadly similar. Aside from the obvious and mandatory differences, the contact leaf shape is subtly different, and the static contact uses thinner wire.
