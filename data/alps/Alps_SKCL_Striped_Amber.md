**Alps SKCL Striped Amber** is a rare linear switch in the "complicated" [Alps SKCL/SKCM series](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series "Alps SKCL/SKCM series"). This switch has only been found in one keyboard, the Tandem 6526 terminal keyboard. This keyboard normally comes with [Alps SKCL Brown](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCL_Brown "Alps SKCL Brown"). Regardless of the main switch the Tandem 6526 still comes with a normal [Alps SKCL Amber](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCL_Amber "Alps SKCL Amber") spacebar switch without any markings.

These switches can be identified by having a red line or stripe that runs vertically down the center of the slider. It appears to be put on by hand by some kind of marker, and is not permanent. This is different from the known 'lipstick' that is put on specialty switches since SKCL Striped Amber has only a thin vertical line while lipstick covers the entire top of the stem. The actuation force appears to be the same as [Alps SKCM Blue](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCM_Blue "Alps SKCM Blue") but the springs are not the same.<ref name="Deskthority" />

These switches are reported to feel different than [Alps SKCL Green](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCL_Green "Alps SKCL Green") or [Alps SKCL Yellow](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCL_Yellow "Alps SKCL Yellow") in that they have a 'cushion' feel rather than the sharp bottoming out of SKCL Green or Yellow. This is typically found on heavier linear switches like [Alps SKCL Brown](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCL_Brown "Alps SKCL Brown"). This switch has only been observed with tall grey switchplates.

Only three confirmed examples of Tandems with these switches have been found so far.
