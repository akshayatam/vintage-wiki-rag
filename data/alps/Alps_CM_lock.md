**Alps SKCL Lock** is an alternate action switch in the [Alps SKCL series](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCL_series "Alps SKCL series"). When the key is depressed, it locks into place and remains down there until pressed a second time. The switch has a normal [switchplate](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Switchplate "Switchplate"), but the shell and slider are modified to accommodate the latching mechanism.

The front of the slider contains a recessed track, and the shell supports a follower arm that moves within this track. A loop within the track holds the slider down until the key is depressed a second time. The follower arm rotates about its lower end, which pivots within recessed area of the open-fronted upper shell; a bar runs across to keep the arm in place. The latching mechanism is partially visible when the keycap is removed, and the slider shape is a giveaway in itself.
