**Alps SKCM White Damped** is a [damped](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Damping "Damping") tactile switch in the [Alps SKCL/SKCM series](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series "Alps SKCL/SKCM series"). Externally it is nearly identical to some [Alps SKCM White](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCM_White "Alps SKCM White") clicky switches; the slider is [white](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/White "White") instead of colourless.

SKCM White Damped appears to be the successor to [Cream Damped](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCM_Cream_Damped "Alps SKCM Cream Damped"), and it appears that it is the version with the slits removed. It appears to use the modified tactile leaf introduced with its predecessor, with the hole removed and small indentations added. The two switches appear to be of the same specifications; this appears to be a cost reduction exercise.

The suggestions are that switch production was in 1995.
