**Alps SKCM Salmon**, or **Salmon Alps** / **Pink Alps**, is a tactile switch in the [Alps SKCL/SKCM series](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series "Alps SKCL/SKCM series"). Salmon Alps are thought to be somewhat stiffer than [SKCM Black](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCM_Black "Alps SKCM Black"), while being smoother. It is also reported to be heavier than [SKCM Orange](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCM_Orange "Alps SKCM Orange").

It appears that SKCM Salmon was introduced after SKCM Orange, and it appears that the two were sold as alternative products for several years. SKCM Salmon is also reported to be contemporary with [SKCM Black](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCM_Black "Alps SKCM Black"), which was the only one of these three tactile switches to remain on sale into the mid 90s.<ref name="MouseFan" /> The [Wang 725-3770](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Wang_725-3770 "Wang 725-3770") suggests that they were still made as late as 1992.

The sliders are lubricated in early versions of the switch, and later versions of the switch might not be.
