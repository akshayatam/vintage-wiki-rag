**Alps Electric Co.** is a Japanese company that is known in the keyboard community primarily for the [Alps SKCL/SKCM series](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series "Alps SKCL/SKCM series") of mechanical keyswitches. Though Alps SKCL/SKCM switches have not been in production for many years, [Alps clone](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_clone "Alps clone") switches are still manufactured today.

The company name "Alps" is often mistakenly written as in all caps—"ALPS"—based on the Alps logotype. The correct capitalization is "Alps".<ref name="Alps-history" /> "ALPs" is another common incorrect capitalization.

Since 2019 the company is known as **Alps Alpine** after merging with Alpine, a former, separate joint venture of Alps Electric and Motorola that started itself in 1967 as **Alps Motorola**.<ref name="AlpsAlpine" />

### Keycaps

\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_Electric&veaction=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Keycaps") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_Electric&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section's source code: Keycaps")\]

Alps double-shot keycaps have distinctive styles that makes them easy to recognise. Evidence suggests that they were only ever sold with keyboards made by Alps, and they have been found on keyboards with a variety of Alps switches, including [Alps SKFL](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKFL "Alps SKFL"), [Alps integrated dome](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_integrated_dome "Alps integrated dome") and [Alps SKCL/SKCM series](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series "Alps SKCL/SKCM series").<ref name="keycap-topic" />

As with other double-shot manufacturers, the moulding patterns vary between keycaps.
