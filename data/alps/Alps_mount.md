This article requires illustration in the form of diagrams — Would be nice to have diagrams of each mount with dimensions

A **keycap mount** is the interface between a [keycap](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Keycap "Keycap") and a [switch](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Keyswitch "Keyswitch"). Some mount types are standardized between switch and keycap manufacturers.

Integrated mounts

A mount is "integrated" when the bottom part of the keycap is the switch mechanism's primary slider. Integrated mount is not a standard: integrated mount keyboards are not incompatible with each other.

Snap-on mounts

Snap-on mounts have flat-topped sliders onto which the keycap is affixed. Snap-on mounts are all proprietary and are not compatible between keyboard types.

Cherry MX mount
---------------

\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Keycap_mount&veaction=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Cherry MX mount") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Keycap_mount&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section's source code: Cherry MX mount")\]

[![](https://wiki.themk.org/images/thumb/a/a6/Cherry_MX_blue_closeup.jpg/400px-Cherry_MX_blue_closeup.jpg)](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Cherry_MX_blue_closeup.jpg)

Cherry MX switch and its mount

A cross-shaped stem on the switch's slider into a cross-shaped hole within a cylindrical stem in the bottom of the keycap. This is often called a "Cherry MX mount" because it is found on [Cherry MX](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Cherry_MX "Cherry MX") switches. Whether the mount type has an industry-wide designation is unknown.

Cherry's MX keycap specifications give the keycap slot dimensions as a cross 4.1+0.05 mm wide, with arms 1.17±0.02 mm wide<ref> [File:Cherry MX 1×1 keycap specification (1983).pdf](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Special:Upload&wpDestFile=Cherry_MX_1%C3%971_keycap_specification_\(1983\).pdf "File:Cherry MX 1×1 keycap specification (1983).pdf") </ref> (this would make them 1.465 mm long). There are no known specifications for the switch stem.

[Signature Plastics](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Signature_Plastics "Signature Plastics") gives the dimensions (presumably of the keycap) as a cross 0.159ʺ (4.04 mm) wide, with arms 0.047ʺ (1.19 mm) wide.

[Cherry M8](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Cherry_M8 "Cherry M8") switches use a cruciform mount with the same lateral dimensions as MX switches, but with a shorter switch stem. This shorter stem leads to keycap incompatibility. Cherry produced a [Cherry MX-M8 Adapter](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Cherry_MX-M8_Adapter "Cherry MX-M8 Adapter") variant of the [Cherry MX](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Cherry_MX "Cherry MX") switch family which allowed the use of shorter M8 keycaps on otherwise standard MX switches.

### Keycap manufacturers and vendors

\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Keycap_mount&veaction=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Keycap manufacturers and vendors") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Keycap_mount&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section's source code: Keycap manufacturers and vendors")\]

### Notes

\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Keycap_mount&veaction=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Notes") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Keycap_mount&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section's source code: Notes")\]

There are also some mount types that are quite similar but not exact like the Cherry MX mount. There are switches with a cylinder around the stem, and there are keys with struts in-between the keycap stem and keycap wall that make it not "Cherry compatible" without modification.

Hirose Cherry mount
-------------------

\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Keycap_mount&veaction=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Hirose Cherry mount") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Keycap_mount&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section's source code: Hirose Cherry mount")\]

Hirose Cherry mount is a smaller cross than Cherry MX mount. Cherry MX keycaps will fit on Hirose Cherry switches, but Hirose Cherry keycaps will not fit on Cherry MX mount keycaps. The horizontal arms are shorter but approximately the same thickness, but the vertical arms of the cross are noticeably thinner, and keycaps made for this mount won't fit onto a Cherry MX mount keycap.

Custom cruciform
----------------

\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Keycap_mount&veaction=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Custom cruciform") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Keycap_mount&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section's source code: Custom cruciform")\]

Main article: [Cross mount clearinghouse](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Cross_mount_clearinghouse "Cross mount clearinghouse") 

There are many keycap mounts that look very similar to Cherry MX mount, but have incompatible dimensions. They will not take Cherry MX keycaps. Such mounts include those of [Cherry M6](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Cherry_M6 "Cherry M6") and [Cherry M7](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Cherry_M7 "Cherry M7") switches. The slider dimensions are not always 90° rotationally symmetrical: one pair of cross arms may be thicker than the perpendicular pair of arms.

Tee and bar mount
-----------------

\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Keycap_mount&veaction=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Tee and bar mount") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Keycap_mount&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section's source code: Tee and bar mount")\]

Numerous switch types have tee (⊢) and bar (|) mount sliders. Such switches typically take cross-mount keycaps, and as such, the switches support full 90° rotational symmetry. For example, the [Alps SKCC series](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCC_series "Alps SKCC series") switch has been found mounted in several orientations, without affecting keycap fit.

Alps mount
----------

\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Keycap_mount&veaction=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Alps mount") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Keycap_mount&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section's source code: Alps mount")\]

Alps-mount keycap and [Alps SKBM White](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKBM_White "Alps SKBM White") switch

A type of mount that is very common for different types of switches. The [slider](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Slider "Slider") has a slot that is around 4.6 mm × 2.3 mm at the top; the [keycap](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Keycap "Keycap") has rectangular peg around 4.5 × 2.2 mm. It is used on various [Alps switches](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Category:Alps_switches "Category:Alps switches") including the [Alps SKCL/SKCM series](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series "Alps SKCL/SKCM series"), and is therefore most often called "Alps mount". The term "Alps mount" does not mean that all Alps switches used this mount: some switches use similar but incompatible mounts, and many more use use totally different mounts. There are more switch types from third parties that use this mount than there are in Alps Electric's entire product range.

Whether there is an industry-wide designation for this type of keycap mount is unknown.

This mount was used for IBM's [Selectric](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Selectric "Selectric") Typewriter and [beam spring](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Beam_spring "Beam spring") switches in the 1960's and 1970's.

The slider has a cubical top with an edge length of 5 mm, underneath of wich are two tiny lugs on opposite sites. The keycap has a mating square hole and recesses where the lugs engage when the keycap is snapped on the slider. RAFI described the mechanism in a patent from 1975,  [GB 1533154](http://worldwide.espacenet.com/textdoc?DB=EPODOC&IDX=GB1533154) , but did not put any claims on it.
