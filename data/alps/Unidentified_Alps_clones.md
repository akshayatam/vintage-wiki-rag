After the introduction of the [Alps SKCL/SKCM series](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series "Alps SKCL/SKCM series") switch in 1983, many companies in the Far East set about producing switches based on the Alps design. These switches are referred to as **[Alps clones](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_clone "Alps clone")** or "**fake Alps**".

There are a large number of subtle variations in the designs, detailed at  [kbtalking.cool3c.com/article/8366](http://kbtalking.cool3c.com/article/8366) .

Many switches have a narrow copper "mantis" [click leaf](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Click_leaf "Click leaf") and [four tabs](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Four-tab_clone "Four-tab clone") that hold the switch against the [mounting plate](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Switch_mount "Switch mount"), which have been universally described as "XM" switches. [Xiang Min](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Xiang_Min "Xiang Min")'s website indicates that their plastics factory opened in 1997, so in all likelihood, Xiang Min themselves copied an an existing clone switch.

Some switch designs such as [Xiang Min KSB series](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Xiang_Min_KSB_series "Xiang Min KSB series") and [Tai-Hao APC series](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Tai-Hao_APC_series "Tai-Hao APC series") have been positively identified with a manufacturer, but the majority of switches are either tentatively identified or simply not identified at all.
