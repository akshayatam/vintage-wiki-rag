**Alps SKFF series**, or **Alps vertical plate spring**, is a switch that shares characteristics of both [Alps SKCP series](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCP_series "Alps SKCP series") and [Alps SKCC series](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCC_series "Alps SKCC series"). It is designed from the outset to support [double action](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Double_action "Double action").

Nomenclature
------------

\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKFF_series&veaction=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Nomenclature") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKFF_series&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section's source code: Nomenclature")\]

The Canon AP400 typewriter in which it was discovered bears the [Alps keyboard codes](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_keyboard_codes "Alps keyboard codes") 12KF006C and KFFBA010; from this, (S)KFF was deduced. The [Apple III](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Apple_III "Apple III") service manual was subsequently found to cite these switches as "KFF". However, they remain listed here as SKFF until Alps's apparent inconsistent naming is better understood.

Description
-----------

\[[edit](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKFF_series&veaction=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Description") | [edit source](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php?title=Alps_SKFF_series&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section's source code: Description")\]

Alps vertical plate spring switches differ from plate spring by having the plate spring assembly mounted vertically down the side of the switch. This change results in the switch being significantly more complicated than the original plate spring switch. The repositioning of the plate spring assembly allows for two separate plate spring assemblies to be fitted side by side, with a staged actuation to provide a double action response to the host.

The switch is clicky, and the click sound created by inversion of the plate spring is specifically mentioned in both US patents.

The ziggurat design of the [slider](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Slider "Slider") is very similar to that of the [Alps SKCC series](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCC_series "Alps SKCC series") switch.

The switch exists in single action and double action variants, and supports a spring-mounted LED just as with SKCC series.

Typically, the keystem is a small and cruciform. It has also been found with a tall, angled bar keystem assumed to be compatible with that of [Alps SKCC Side-Angled Cream](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCC_Side-Angled_Cream "Alps SKCC Side-Angled Cream"), both of which are from Swedish-made Facit typewriters.
