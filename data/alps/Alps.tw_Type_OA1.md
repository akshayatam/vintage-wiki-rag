**alps.tw Type OA1** is an [Alps clone](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_clone "Alps clone") variant designed to resemble a genuine unbranded [Alps SKCL/SKCM series](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series "Alps SKCL/SKCM series") switch. The switch is identical to alps.tw Type OA2 ([Simplified Alps Type IV](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Simplified_Alps_Type_IV "Simplified Alps Type IV")) with the exception of the upper shell bearing a replica of Alps's [mould numbering](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Mould_numbering "Mould numbering"), and the side extensions found on genuine Alps switches. The lower shell has not been documented, but it is presumed to be a [four-tab](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Four-tab_clone "Four-tab clone") design. Internally, the upper shell bears the appropriate grooves required to support the contact plates.

In the past, the switch was incorrectly listed by alps.tw as [Simplified Alps Type III](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Simplified_Alps_Type_III "Simplified Alps Type III"), but it has subsequently been recognised to be a very similar, but distinct product.

The origin of alps.tw's OA1 keyboard is not known, and no other keyboards are positively known to use this switch. The [mould numbering](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Mould_numbering "Mould numbering") characteristics are highly unusual though, as it is assumed to have a white or ivory slider, and as such it should bear the Alps logo.
