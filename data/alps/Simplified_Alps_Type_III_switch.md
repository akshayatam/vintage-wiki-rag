**Simplified Alps Type III** is a switch that combines [Hua-Jie AK series](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Hua-Jie_AK_series "Hua-Jie AK series")\-style internals with what appear to be genuine Alps shells. The switch shell resembles that of genuine [Alps SKCM Blue](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps_SKCM_Blue "Alps SKCM Blue"), including the long side tabs, but some of the numbering is missing. Since complicated Alps shells cannot support simplified mechanisms, the switch contains a small support frame to hold the contact plates apart; the frame has approximately the same overall thickness as the [switchplate](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Switchplate "Switchplate") that would normally be present.

One suggestion was that the shells were stolen rejects from a factory producing genuine Alps switches. Switches that appear to be genuine white Alps have since been found with these same unbranded, incompletely-numbered upper shells, in the [DSI Modular Pro](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/DSI_Modular_Pro "DSI Modular Pro") keyboard. Dates in the Modular Pro keyboard are all from mid 1990. Webwit's Datacomp DFK191A301 also appears to have these erroneous switches.<ref>Deskthority â€” [The Wild Duck Exotics Boutique](https://deskthority.net/f-o-r-s-a-l-e-f58/the-wild-duck-exotics-boutique-t10089.html)</ref> As a note, the varying orientation of the circled numbers suggests that these positions are batch numbers using drop-in cylinders, similar to the date wheels found in keyboard case moulds. The reason for the missing numbers is not clear.

The switch also has an uncharacteristic vivid blue [slider](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Slider "Slider"), only otherwise found in [Taiwan Tai-Hao APC series](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Taiwan_Tai-Hao_APC_series "Taiwan Tai-Hao APC series") switches.

This switch is only known to exist in the [Focus FK-2001](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Focus_FK-2001 "Focus FK-2001") keyboard.

Main article: [Alps.tw Type OA1](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Alps.tw_Type_OA1 "Alps.tw Type OA1") 

alps.tw previously referred to type "OA1" as being Simplified Alps Type III. It has since been determined to be a similar, but distinct and potentially unrelated switch. The key difference between the two is that Simplified Alps Type III appears to use real Alps shells, while Type OA1 has custom-moulded replica shells with integrated support for clone switch contacts, with no need for a support frame.
