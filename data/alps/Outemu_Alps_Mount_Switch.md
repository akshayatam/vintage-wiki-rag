Outemu Alps Mount Switch is an obscure [Gaote](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/Gaote "Gaote")/Outemu switch with an Alps Mount compatible slider. It is available in at least one variant, with a clicky response and a blue slider. The slider resembles the rectangular slider of a [KPT switch](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/KPT_switch "KPT switch"). The enclosure is transparent. Interestingly, despite having an Alps Mount compatible slider, this switch has what appears to be an MX Compatible pin profile.

These switches have been listed on Taobao in the past, and were formerly available at [this page](https://mechbox.co.uk/products/outemu-blue-switch-alps-mount) on mechbox.co.uk, which listed actuation force as 60g.
