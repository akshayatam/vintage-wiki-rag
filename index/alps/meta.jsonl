Like many of their other switches, Alps buckling spring switches take Alps mountkeycaps.\nDescription\n-----------\n\\[edit | edit source\\]\nThis mechanism was patented by Alps in 1989 as the **\"Push button switch with actuator for applying transverse force to buckling spring\"**, with Takafumi Kato as the inventor. It is commonly associated with the keyboard of the IBM\\-designed Sega TeraDrive, although it was used in some non-IBM keyboards such as certain C. Itoh\") terminal keyboards. It is unknown if it was developed by request of IBM, or whether it developed under Alps's own initiative, and later picked by IBM for the Sega TeraDrive design.\n![](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Fig5ALps.jpg)\nDiagram from Alps patent showing hammer with follower\nAccording to the patent, the switch was designed to have a lower profile than other buckling spring implementations. As with IBM membrane and Brother designs, Alps buckling spring is a hammer-over-membrane design. However, it differs in that the pivoting hammer has a follower behind the spring which pushes the spring forward during travel. The patent describes this modification as being necessary in a compact buckling spring switch to ensure that a short spring will buckle forward properly. It also noted that a regular buckling spring mechanism needed springs manufactured to very specific tolerances for the spring to buckle properly, which might imply that assisting the buckling of the spring with a follower would allow cheaper springs to be used. This switch uses a shorter spring than other buckling spring implementations, and has notably less key travel. It also has lower force requirements than other buckling spring swit", "doc_type": "switch", "is_redirect": false}

These labels have typically two codes, of which one is never understood. The other type of code begins \"K\" or \"KF\" and it provides letters three and four of the switch series. For example, KF**FL**EB004C indicates Alps SKFL series. In the case of KFFBA010, this is taken to be SKFF series on the assumption that there is no extraneous \"F\": K**FF**BA010.\nThe importance of these codes is clear: obtaining these codes provides the identity of Alps switch series in the absence of any catalogues or datasheets. Alps SKFL series was identified solely using the KFFLEB004C code, which was subsequently confirmed true by search engine results for a stock of surplus SKFL series switches sold by Technology Transplant. The KF codes—that identify the full series name—are comparatively rare; the best source of these is Canon typewriters, which were consistently provided with these labels and which used a wide variety of Alps switch types.\nKnown codes\n-----------\n\\[edit | edit source\\]\nA circle is assumed to be \"0\" (zero) not \"O\".

The slider color is very similar to that of Amber Omron B3G-S series switches, but not quite as saturated.\nThe switches are considerably higher weighted, coming in at somewhere between 80 and 100 gf. Variation in characteristics due to age must be considered however, before this is taken as fact.\nThe bottom of the click leaf is not folded inwards as with other Alps switches.

The switch appears to be an earlier Hua-Jie AK-CN2 adapted to use a shell derived from an Alps SKCMAG; unlike most clones, Type III is clearly intended to fool people into mistaking it for a real Alps product, aided by Alps having neglected to visibly brand their switches.\nThe most obvious difference between the clone and genuine article is that the clone switch has a vivid blue slider, instead of the blue-grey of the Alps product. The clone switch replicates the telltale slits in the slider hole as well as the long side tabs that normally indicate a genuine Alps switch. The upper shell may be derived directly from an Alps moulding, as a plastic support plate was required to support the contact plates where normally the shell has dedicated recesses. A similar switch has been found with a custom shell with the proper recesses.\n*   ![Type III simplified, disassembled](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Simplified_Alps_T", "doc_type": "switch", "is_redirect": false}

Depth is approximately 13 mm, and width is approximately 15 mm (approximately 14 mm excluding the legs, which protrude from the sides). The slider has around 3.7 mm of travel.\nThe switch is PCB mount only. The base of the switch is grey moulded plastic (which is sometimes mistaken for metal), above which is a sheet steel lid with folded-down sides. The Alps logo is stamped into the lid. The sides of the lid lock into place into the plastic base with small lugs stamped into the metal. The ends of the sides then protrude through the PCB and are soldered alongside the legs from the electrical contacts. It is likely that the switch can only be opened when de-soldered, and even then opening the switch without causing damage is extremely difficult. The electrical contact legs protrude sideways from holes in the side of the switch, instead of from the bottom of the switch.\nThe switch contains an internal recess for an LED, which is covered by the lid. The LED version of the switch has a different lid with a hole for the LED. The base of the switch contains a slot for the LED, with a retention clip to hold the LED in place. There are also two further holes present, possibly intended for a jumper or diode; there is also a bay under the rear of the switch to allow for a diode or jumper to be placed beneath the switch instead", "doc_type": "switch", "is_redirect": false}

The colour is similar to that found in Xiang Min KSB series, but it is deeper and more vivid.\nThe force curve of Alps SKCM Green is different to most other Alps tactile switches. The step in the tactile leaf that catches the slider starts higher up and is longer. This change leads to a tactile peak that is longer and more rounded. Although the peak force of SKCM Green is lower than that of other tactile switches, a high level of force is held for longer, which may account for its stiffer feel. Based on the similarity of the tactile leaf and feel, and on the possible change from SKCM Brown to SKCM Green in Xerox and Texas Instruments keyboards, it has been postulated that SKCM Green is the successor to SKCM Brown, in the same manner that Alps SKCM White replaced Alps SKCM Blue and so forth.\nVariants\n--------\n\\[edit | edit source\\]\nBoth pine and bamboo variants exist.

The original catalogue was in colour, and was scanned to PDF. Black and white photostat copies were also made and passed to various people. The original catalogue and the PDF document are considered lost, as are all photocopies besides Sandy's, which is the only copy known to remain.\nThe catalogue is known to cover the following switches:\nSKCL\nSKCLAR, SKCLAQ, SKCLJC, SKCLFQ, SKCLFM, SKCLBB\nSKCM\nSKCMAP, SKCMAQ, SKCMAT, SKCMBB\nSKFR\nSKFRAC, SKFRAD, SKFRFA, SKFRFB, SKFRFC\nSKFS\nSKFSAA\nThe owner of the catalogue asked Alps Electric for permission to republish it, and was denied. Photos provided from Sandy depicting parts of pages (but not whole pages) were posted to Deskthority and Geekhack before Alps's prior restriction was noted.\nThe SKCL/SKCM part numbers come from Sandy's transcript. SKFR/SKFS part numbers likely also came from Sandy; currently the only confirmed details are in an archive of geekhack wiki, which itself cited this same catalogue.Geekhack — Default:ALPS switches (archive) Archived 2014-01-12.

This is virtually identical to the spring in grey switchplate Alps SKCC Tall Cream, indicating that they do indeed differ solely in keystem height.\nThe specifications for the Alps AKB-3420 includes the switches. The model number for the switches is not given, but all in all examples found to date, they are SKCC Cream. An older example of this keyboard ca. 1979 specifies the switch lifetime as 3×10⁶ cycles in the product literature, while a later example from ca. 1988 specifies the switch lifetime as 2×10⁷; it is not known whether this large increase was due to greater testing time, or improvements to the design. Based on non-scientific keystem-to-keystem testing, SKCC Green appears to provide 60 gf actuation, so with the 11:9 free turn ratio of the Cream and Green return springs, the heavier SKCC Cream would be in the region of 70 gf actuation. Only the \"operating force\" is officially specified, at 90±25 g, which will be total travel force.\nPart SKCCBJ0001 has two separated terminal recesses with semicircular ends, just as found in Alps SKCC Green part SKCCBK0001. Normally there is only a single terminal recess, typically with straight ends. This version has a spring in the region of 10.3–10.6 mm long, also of 0.22 mm gauge wire, but only seven active turns.\nKeyboards\n---------\n\\[edit | edit source\\]\n*   Adtek System Science SKB-01\n*   Alps AKB-3420\n*   Some Apple III keyboards\n*   Bondwell 14\n*   Some Dragon Data D", "doc_type": "switch", "is_redirect": false}

The switch shell resembles that of genuine Alps SKCM Blue, including the long side tabs, but some of the numbering is missing. Since complicated Alps shells cannot support simplified mechanisms, the switch contains a small support frame to hold the contact plates apart; the frame has approximately the same overall thickness as the switchplate that would normally be present.\nOne suggestion was that the shells were stolen rejects from a factory producing genuine Alps switches. Switches that appear to be genuine white Alps have since been found with these same unbranded, incompletely-numbered upper shells, in the DSI Modular Pro keyboard. Dates in the Modular Pro keyboard are all from mid 1990. Webwit's Datacomp DFK191A301 also appears to have these erroneous switches.Deskthority — The Wild Duck Exotics Boutique As a note, the varying orientation of the circled numbers suggests that these positions are batch numbers using drop-in cylinders, similar to the date wheels found in keyboard case moulds.

SKCP series, as the \"SKC\" implies, is a switchplate\\-based enhancement of the design, with a patent filed ten years later. This switch appears to slightly pre-date the introduction of the click leaf and Alps SKCM Blue.\nThe series name of \"SKCP\" is derived from a label in a Canon AP 560 typewriter.\nDescription\n-----------\n\\[edit | edit source\\]\nThe switch could be described in some ways as a simplified beam spring switch, as it uses a flat spring to generate tactility and actuate the contact mechanism. The return spring is held captive inside the slider by a block that clips into the primary slider from below. When the slider is removed, the return spring remains inside the slider. This slider/spring/block arrangement presses down onto the plate spring. The helical–plate spring pairing provides hysteresis and pretravel.\nTotal travel is 4 mm. Attempts to measure the plate spring snap and release points with callipers yields a snap point between 2.2 and 2.5 mm, and a release point between 1.3 and 1.6 mm, with the exact points varying from stroke to stroke. The perceptual hysteresis seems to be somewhere in the region of 1 mm, but this is hard to determine with callipers as, even using the thumbwheel to increment the switch travel and release, the kick from the plate spring is enough to cause a significant misreading.

Testing with a multimeter shows however that the click and tactile feel does not directly correspond with contact operation. The actuation feedback does correspond with the actuation itself, but the contact hysteresis is much lower than the perceived hysteresis. After actuating the switch, releasing the slider a small amount will allow the switch to be \"teased\" (generating a resistance proportional to slider position in either direction), and after a short release distance the contacts will fully disengage. The slider can then be released significantly further before the plate spring snaps back, at which point a second click is heard. As the tests was performed on a used switch, and no documentation for the switches has been found, it is not known whether this discrepancy is due to the design or due to wear within the switch.\nThe slider is compatible with the same keycaps as Alps SKCL/SKCM series switches.\nEarly switches in IBM keyboards were PCB mounted; later ones were plate mounted. PCB mounted switches have a different lower shell from plate mounted switches. The PCB mounted variant cannot snap into a typical alps mount.\nThe side tabs to hold the top of the switch to the bottom are much weaker than those on Alps SKCL/SKCM. Unlike the tab on SKCC which can break, on SKCP the top of the housing is held by the bottom by small tabs which press into horizontal slits on the bottom housing. If opened incorrectly the lower housing can bend outward and not fully grip the top. This may result in keycap removal pulling the entire top of the switch off or in the worst cases, occasional return spring force ejecting the top housing.\nSKCP series is generally known only for its standard momentary switch.

The 1994 Alps catalogue refers to it as SKCMAQ; an un-dated Alps datasheet describes a switch that appears to be identical except for lacking slits, which is given part number SKCMCQ. It is possible that the change from 'A' to 'C' indicates the redesigned switch with the slits removed, as the same datasheet depicts SKCLAR with the 'A' in the part number, and with slits.\nThe majority of complicated White Alps switches are branded \"ALPS\", but the earliest examples are reported to be unbranded. In most cases, they use the same mould numbering as other common generation Alps SKCL/SKCM switches, but in some cases, a simplified form of mould numbering has been found, with what often resembles hand-carved numbers, and a slightly distorted Alps logo. However, these do appear to be genuine Alps switches. Interestingly, these varieties of switches do not follow the standard practice of having the switchplate at the rear of the switch; in the same keyboard, the switches can be found with the branding and numbering both ways up.\nWhite Alps is typically found to be less favourable than its predecessor, Alps SKCM Blue, with blue widely held to have a better feel; although feel is both subjective and dependent on switch condition, the consensus of opinion across recent years all points in favour of blue Alps being superior in fe", "doc_type": "switch", "is_redirect": false}

The transition from blue to White Alps is the best-known example of the evolution of the SKCL/SKCM series. Curiously, it appears that the very first White Alps switches retained the dry lubricant and return spring material of blue Alps, indicating that the Blue-to-White transition was not a clean break but itself a series of transitions; here, the older dry-lubricated version is held to be superior.\nVariants\n--------\n\\[edit | edit source\\]\nKnown variants include:\nSwitchplate Color\nSwitchplate Length\nAlps Logo\nGeneration\nWhite\nLong\nNo Logo\nPine (with slits)\nWhite\nShort\nNo Logo\nPine (with slits)\nWhite\nShort\nLogo\nPine (with slits)\nWhite\nShort\nLogo\nBamboo (without slits)\nKeyboards\n---------\n\\[edit | edit source\\]\n*   Some Acer 6010 series\n*   Some Acer KB-084AS\n*   Some Acer KB-101A\n*   Aquarius CSK-2101 & CSK-2102\n*   Canon A220-UKB84\n*   Canon A290-PSK\n*   Canon CE-KB08\n*   Some Chicony KB-5161 & KB-5162\n*   Some Chicony KB-5181\n*   Some Chicony KB-9600\n*   Costar CSJ-2106\n*   Some Costar CSK-7102N\n*   Dan 102 Key UK keyboard\n*   Some Datacomp DFK-102\n*   Datacomp DFK-191 & DFK-192\n*   Some Datacomp DFK-2020\n*   Datacomp DSK-119\n*   Datacomp MTX-124\n*   Datadesk Switchboard\n*   DSI Modular Pro\n*   DTK SPK-101\n*   Some Focus FK-2000 Plus\n*   Some Focus FK-2001 & FK-2002\n*   Some Focus FK-3001 & FK-3002\n*   Focus FK-5001\n*   Some Focus FK-6000\n*   Some Focus FK-7000P\n*   Some Focus FK-9000\n*   Some Forward Electronics FDA-102(A)\n*   Fuji Xerox XJ-T99\n*   Great Wall KBD5-B\n*   Some Jameco JE2016\n*   Jing Mold Electronic Technology JKB-6151M\n*   Some Kinesis Evolution\n*   Some Leading Edge AK-1012\n*   Some Leading Edge DC-2214\n*   Lite-On SK-0002\n*   Mitac KB-5202\n*   Some Monterey K101\n*   Some Monterey K104\n*   Some Monterey K108\n*   Monterey MK-9500\n*   Most Northgate OmniKey\n*   Some NTC KB-6151\n*   Some NTC KB-6251 & 6252\n*   NTC KB-6551EA\n*   NTC KB-6851\n*   Olivetti ANK26-105J", "doc_type": "switch", "is_redirect": false}

The slider is a different design, and reversible. By the debut of Alps SKCM Brown, the shell and slider were both redesigned, but linear switches kept the 1983-style shell for several years, and it appears that Linear Green Alps also retained the original slider design.\nThe exact relationship between Linear Green and Yellow Alps remains a mystery. While it's undisputed that Linear Green is older and that Yellow became its replacement, the two overlapped, and the reason for this is unknown. Zenith keyboards have been found with Green/Yellow and Yellow/Green pairings, with one type used for normal keys and the other type used for LED keys. Curiously, this even went as far as top-branded Linear Green Alps in a Zenith ZKB-2R.\nAs with Alps SKCL Yellow, it appears that the holes for the LED legs were not provided unless the switch was ordered with an LED fitted in the factory.\nLinear Green Alps are highly regarded for being an exceptionally smooth linear switch.\nVariants\n--------\n\\[edit | edit source\\]\nKnown variants include:\nSwitchplate Color\nSwitchplate Length\nAlps Logo\nGeneration\nBlack\nLong\nNo Logo\nPine (with slits)\nGrey\nLong\nNo Logo\nPine (with slits)\nWhite\nLong\nNo Logo\nPine (with slits)\n**Early Variant**\nExamples have been found of early SKCL Green Alps containing differently shaped sliders, top housings and bottom ho", "doc_type": "switch", "is_redirect": false}

Typically this recess is left empty. It appears that switches ordered without an LED pre-fitted lacked the LED holes in the lower shell.\nYellow Alps appears to be the longest-running product in the SKCL/SKCM series. It appears to have been introduced around 1988, with approximately two years' overlap with Alps SKCL Green; the latter appears to be slightly lower in force. The earliest Yellow Alps switches had long slits and no Alps logo, but by 1990 or so the mould had been replaced with one with the Alps logo and short slits. The SKCLAR/SKCMCQ data sheet along with MouseFan's data suggests that the slits were never removed.\nVariants\n--------\n\\[edit | edit source\\]\nKnown variants include:\nSwitchplate Color\nSwitchplate Length\nAlps Logo\nGeneration\nWhite\nShort\nLogo\nPine (with slits)\nPart number\nDescription\nSource\nSKCLAR\nNo LED fitted?\n1994 catalogue\nSKCLFQ\nRed LED fitted\n1994 catalogue\nSKCLFM\nGreen LED fitted\n1994 catalogue\nKeyboards\n---------\n\\[edit | edit source\\]\n*   Some ASkeyboard Sono1\n*   C.itoh CIT482F\n*   Some Emerson KCLEA907L\n*   Emerson KFCLEA916A\n*   Graphite 101-key\n*   Some IBM Multistation Keyboards (IBM 5556)\n*   Intecolor AGS\n*   Mitsubishi M-", "doc_type": "switch", "is_redirect": false}

The most common variety is the clicky variant with the blue slider, widely referred to as a **Monterey switch**; the popular moniker \"Monterey\" owes its origin to the switch being discovered in a Monterey K104 keyboard, and the choice of name is attributed to Japanese keyboard collector MouseFan. The tactile variety was used in the Apple Desktop Bus Keyboard, suggesting an introduction date of 1986 or earlier.\nContents\n--------\n*   1  Description\n*   2  Authenticity\n*   3  Key feel\n*   4  Variants\n*   5  Keyboards\n*   6  Gallery\n    *   6.1  Comparison with inverse cross mount\n*   7  External links\n*   8  References\nDescription\n-----------\n\\[edit | edit source\\]\nThe keycaps are compatible with Alps SKCL/SKCM series switches, but the switch has a different mounting hole and pin layout. A coiled spring provides most of the resistance, and there are two leaf springs for contact and click/tactility respectively.\nThis is the only SMK second generation switch to lack fixing pins, making it plate mount only.\nThe switch's feel has made it well regarded among keyboard enthusiasts.\nAuthenticity\n------------\n\\[edit | edit source\\]\nUnlike other switches in this family, the base of the Alps-mount switches are not SMK branded; this led many people to believe the switch to be a copy.\nThe Apple IIGS Technical Procedures confirm that the tactile version in the Apple Desktop Bus Keyboard is SMK. Both Monterey and Chicony have confirmed purchasing these switches from SMK. No reason for the lack of branding is known, although another difference with this variant is the lack of PCB fixing pins.

This switch has only been found in one keyboard, the Tandem 6526 terminal keyboard. This keyboard normally comes with Alps SKCL Brown. Regardless of the main switch the Tandem 6526 still comes with a normal Alps SKCL Amber spacebar switch without any markings.\nThese switches can be identified by having a red line or stripe that runs vertically down the center of the slider. It appears to be put on by hand by some kind of marker, and is not permanent. This is different from the known 'lipstick' that is put on specialty switches since SKCL Striped Amber has only a thin vertical line while lipstick covers the entire top of the stem. The actuation force appears to be the same as Alps SKCM Blue but the springs are not the same.\nThese switches are reported to feel different than Alps SKCL Green or Alps SKCL Yellow in that they have a 'cushion' feel rather than the sharp bottoming out of SKCL Green or Yellow. This is typically found on heavier linear switches like Alps SKCL Brown. This switch has only been observed with tall grey switchplates.\nOnly three confirmed examples of Tandems with these switches have been found so far.\nKeyboards\n---------\n\\[edit | edit source\\]\n*   Tandem 6526 Terminal Keyboard\nGallery\n-------\n\\[edit | edit source\\]\n*   ![Up close you can see the uniqueness of each stripe](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Skclstriped.jpg \"Up close you can see the uniqueness of each stripe\") Up close you can see the uniqueness of each stripe\n*   ![SKCL Striped Amber in a Tandem 6526 terminal keyboard](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Stripedtandem.jpg \"SKCL Striped Amber in a Tandem 6526 terminal keyboard\") SKCL Striped Amber in a Tandem 6526 terminal keyboard\n*   ![SKCL Striped Amber components](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Stripedambercomponets.jpg \"SKCL Striped Amber components\")", "doc_type": "switch", "is_redirect": false}

Over the years there have been many variants of the keyswitch, including changes in colour and design. Early variants of the Alps switch did not carry the Alps logo on the top part of the case, and only had it moulded into the base of the switch.\nThe terms \"ALPS\" and \"Alps\" are widely misused to refer to a large number of clone switches manufactured by other companies, as well as similar-looking switches that share the same keycap mount; although most clones are clearly different from genuine Alps switches, they are similar enough that many people fail to differentiate Alps switches from the copies.\nContents\n--------\n*   1  Nomenclature\n*   2  Evolution\n    *   2.1  Generations\n*   3  Design\n    *   3.1  Shell\n    *   3.2  Slider\n    *   3.3  Leaf springs\n        *   3.3.1  Modification\n    *   3.4  Switchplate\n    *   3.5  Latching action\n    *   3.6  Slits\n    *   3.7  Logo\n*   4  Simplified Alps\n*   5  Recognition\n*   6  Korean switches\n*   7  Variants\n*   8  Keyboards\n*   9  Specifications\n*   10  Maintenance\n*   11  Exter", "doc_type": "switch", "is_redirect": false}

It also appears that the series name changed within Alps. The 1994 Alps catalogue apparently referred to \"**CL series**\" and \"**CM series**\", indicating that the previous community name \"**Alps CM**\" may be correct, for a subset of the switches (the tactile and clicky models). A catalogue fragment for Alps SKCM Blue also suggests CM series or even KCM. The Alps data sheet below—depicting what seems to be bamboo white (SKCLCQ)—uses the term \"SKCL/SKCM series\" (\"SKCL／SKCMシリーズ\"), suggesting that Alps changed the series name in the mid 90s; there was also very tentative evidence that Alps SKFL series was referred to in this manner.\n\"Bigfoot\" as a moniker derives from the term \"Alps Bigfoot\" used to refer to the Alps standard keyboard platform. The term \"Complicated Alps\" comes from the complexity of the design, with a fairly high 10–13 parts per switch, especially in comparison to the \"simplified\" Alps SKBL/SKBM series that followed it.\nThere is no known name or term that covers both complicated (SKCL/SKCM) and simplified (SKBL/SKBM series) switches. According to Sandy, 'SK' stands for \"single key\"; \"SK\" is used in the part numbers of many Alps switches.\nEvolution\n---------\n\\[edit | edit source\\]\nSKCL/SKCM series itself appears to a DIN standard re-imagining of the earlier Alps SKCC series. The \"switchplate\" contact assembly was lifted wholesale from the earlier switch; the important changes were repositioning the mounting plate to be much lower down the switch body, and a new slider design that allowed the mounting stem within the keycap to pass inside the switch. While SKCC and SKCL/SKCM are around the same size as each other, these changes permitted a substantial reduction in keyboard profile without altering the switching operation in any way.

The redesigned shell also brought with it a different approach to illumination, placing the LED inside the switch instead of supported above it on coil springs.\nThe exact design goals are currently unknown. The new shell left space to introduce a click leaf in place of the LED. Because the slits in the tactile switch shell are shorter than the slits of the linear switch, it would seem that this was an afterthought; later linear switches adopted the shorter slits when the shells were retooled at the end of the 1980s. The early history remains speculation, due to a lack of documentation and very limited dating evidence.\nThe SKCL/SKCM design was modified numerous times by Alps over its lifetime. This process remains poorly understood, but a number of changes have been noted. Some of these points are expanded further under Design, below.\nTerminal sealant has been found in one instance.Deskthority — Alps Appreciation (post 352622)\n*   The original SKCL shell from ca. 1983 used longer, potentially more fragile tabs between the slits, and black switchplates\n*   When SKCM was introduced shortly afterwards, the new non-LED shell used shorter slits\n*   Around 1984 or so, the switchplate colour changed from black to grey\n*   Around 1989, all the slider colours changed, with the suggestion being that a newer, smoother plastic was used (this can be seen in the shinier sliders of switches from this point onwards and the lack of dry lubricant on switches from this period onwards); this was not a clean break, as SKCM White continued to use dry lubricant briefly after it replaced SKCM Blue, and uncertainty remains as to which older switches correspond to which newer switches\n*   The 1989–1990 overhaul also saw the introduction of top branding on switches—using the newer Alps logo—and SKCL switches changed over to the shorter tabs between the slits when the shells were retooled (noticeable in comparison between typical SKCL Green and typical SKCL Yellow)\n*   Other changes during the 1989–1990 overhaul inclu", "doc_type": "switch", "is_redirect": false}

The tactile or click leaf needs to occupy this slot, making tactility and illumination mutually exclusive; this design limitation would become a problem with the Matias Tactile Pro series, where customers mistook the necessarily linear LED key switches as manufacturing defects.\nAll standard linear switches have a recess for an LED. Surprisingly, most of these switches will not actually accept an LED, as there are no holes in the base for the LED legs. Separate part numbers existed for the LED versions, one per LED colour.

The slider colour helps to identify the switch variant, in combination with other details such as the upper shell design.\nAlps sliders are horizontally symmetrical (the right side mirrors the left side), but in most cases they are not rotationally symmetrical: the back is not a mirror of the front, and the slider is not considered to be reversible. In particular, there is a small notch cut into the base at the rear; this side always faces the switchplate. The notched side also has a rounded edge, presumably to ensure smooth actuation and minimize contact bounce. The front side of the slider has a sharp edge which minimizes drag against the tactile leaf. Because of this, reversing the slider will make the switch feel heavier and less crisp. This design was maintained with Alps SKBL/SKBM series \"simplified\" Alps, but no Alps clone switches are known to have copied this characteristic, as they all have reversible sliders.\nAlps SKCL Green is an exception here in that the slider is reversible, has a longer spring support stem, and equally-sized small notches on both sides.

Following on from Alps SKCC series, the original SKCL switches were linear. It appears that the first attempt at tactile feedback was the Alps SKCM Brown; this was a skeleton switchplate designed to expand the tactility inherent in the actuator leaf design.\nThis was shortly followed by Alps SKCM Blue, which introduced the idea of a folded leaf spring that is pulled away from the inside of the shell by the slider, and allowed to snap back into place to generate an audible sound. Blue Alps switches appeared around 1985, while the earliest SMK second generation switches have been found from 1986.\nThe click leaf concept was subsequently used in many switches, including SMK second generation switches and the Omron B3G-S series as well as most Alps clone switches, Alps derivatives, and Alps-SMK hybrid switches such as the KPT switch.\nThe progression of the tactile leaf is not clear; it may have been a derivative of the click leaf, or it may be that both designs were introduced at the same time, as Alps SKCM Cream, which so far has been found to have a standard folded tactile leaf. The folded tactile leaf is similar to the click leaf, but two additional protrusions prevent it from being pulled forward, so it does not generate a click. The consequence of this design is that the tactility is not as strong as that generated by a click leaf. Tactile leaves often have a hole stamped in the centre; the reason for this is not known. It appears to have been absent in SKCM Cream, then present for Alps SKCM Orange onwards, and removed again with Alps SKCM White Damped.\n*   ![Original tactile leaf in SKCM Brown](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Alps_CM_brown_--_tactile_assembly_1.jpg \"Original tactile leaf in SKCM Brown\") Original tactile leaf in SKCM Brown\n*   ![Click leaf in an Alps SKCM Amber switch](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Alps_SKCM_Amber_--_click_leaf.jpg \"Click leaf in an Alps SKCM Amber switch\") Click leaf in an Alps SKCM Amber switch\n*   ![Click leaf (left) compared to tactile leaf", "doc_type": "switch", "is_redirect": false}

It contains two terminals, with a flexible metal foil membrane placed against the first that is held apart from the second by a plastic separator. This assembly is held inside a plastic plate, above which a sprung actuator leaf is fitted. The slider bends the actuator leaf back against the plastic plate, where it presses a flap against the foil membrane, which is pressed against the rear terminal.\nThe plastic block initially extended down to the base of the shell; this is a known as a \"long\" switchplate. Later switches had this plastic block reduced in height, leaving a gap between it and the bottom of the shell; this is termed a \"short\" switchplate. There has been speculation that reducing the length of the switchplate degrades the smoothness of the switch, but this seems unlikely. Short switchplates are supported by two small posts adjacent to the holes for the legs.\nThe colour of the switchplate has also changed twice. Early switches used the black switchplates from Alps SKCC series switches. The colour was soon changed to grey, with no other apparent change. Around 1987, the colour was changed again, to translucent white, which would be the final colour. The height was changed from long to short soon afterwards, around 1988.\nIn most switches, the switchplate is at the rear of the switch with respect to the orientation of the numbering and branding. Alps SKCM White was an exception, with certain production runs having the branding orientated \"upside down\", seemingly randomly between the different moulds in the tooling. Alps clone switches frequently placed the contacts at the front of the switch instead, and simplified Alps switches appear to have reversed the orientation initially.\n*   ![Opened black Alps switch showing the shorter switchplate](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Black_Alps_CM_lower_shell_and_switchplate.jpg \"Opened black Alps switch showing the shorter switchplate\") Opened black Alps switch showing the shorter switchplate\n*   ![Short and long white switchplates](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Switchplate_--_Alps,_short_", "doc_type": "switch", "is_redirect": false}

There are three switch types that appear to be specific to Korea: Alps SKCL Brown (replacing green), Alps SKCL Amber (replacing cream), and a brown version of Alps SKCL Lock (which if it were to follow Japanese colour convention would be amber to match the heavier momentary switch). Keyboards made by Gold Star Alps have been found with Alps keyboard codes ending with an extra letter \"K\", while one of the keyboards with SKCL Brown switches (a Visual Technology terminal keyboard) of unknown manufacture also has a PCB code ending \"K\". Details of Leading Edge keyboards is scarce, but a Leading Edge DC-3014 has been found with SKCL Brown (tying in with Leading Edge being owned by Korean manufacturer Daewoo), while photos of a blue Alps DC-2014 show a PCB code without the final 'K'.\nThere may not be a direct correspondence between the \"K\" suffix and Korea, but there is evidence to suggest that Korean production of linear switches used different pigment.

The switches are maintenance-free if used in a clean environment.\nUnfortunately, the relatively open design of these switches (particularly the \"pine\" variant with slits) and the relatively large area of tight tolerance between the switch sliders and the switch top housing, makes the Alps SKCL/SKCM series switches particularly prone to dirt incursion.\nDirty Alps switches will feel scratchy, sluggish, and uneven. By comparison, new or well maintained switches should feel light, crisp, and precise.\nAfter some experimentation, Deskthority user XMIT has found that **with a good thorough cleaning of the sliders and switch tops, and a shot of compressed air in the bottoms and the switch plates, even the dirtiest of switches can feel like new,** so long as the springs or switch plates are not rusted. An ultrasonic cleaner is recommended for cleaning the switch tops and the switch sliders. Ultrasonic cleaning is not recommended or generally necessary for the switch housing bottoms, switch plates, springs, or leaves.\nLubrication does not improve the feel of a thoroughly cleaned switch by much.

SKCC Green's spring has been measured as 10.7 mm long with 0.21 mm gauge wire.\nBased on non-scientific keystem-to-keystem testing, SKCC Green appears to be the same weight as General Instrument Series S950 (rated at 60 gf), while it is heaver than RAFI RS 76 C 010 (estimated 50 cN). SKCC Green also appears to share the same return spring as S95010. This would suggest a 60 gf actuation force for Green.

The damper does not reach to the bottom of the slider, so the stops moulded into the base of the shell have been widened to accommodate.\nVariants of the switch exist both with slits and without, with slits being the significantly more common variety. The model was followed by SKCM White Damped, which differs in that the sliders are made from a different plastic and the switch weighting is slightly heavier, though is otherwise identical to Ivory without slits.\nIt appears that the tactile leaf was modified during its production run, with the hole removed, and small indentations introduced.

The design drawings were amended to match.\nMatias Corporation was responsible for continued production of SKBL/SKBM switches, by taking a gamble on the million-switch order required to keep the factory alive; this was required to maintain production of the switches used in the original Tactile Pro.\\[Citation needed\\] However, production was finally terminated in early 2012. The final batches of the Tactile Pro 3 had to use their new Matias switch, as stocks of SKBM switches ran out prematurely. The Matias switch is a clone of the SKBL/SKBM series.\nDetails\n-------\n\\[edit | edit source\\]\nSKBL/SKBM series switches have significantly less mould numbering compared to SKCL/SKCM.

The Apple III service manual was since found to cite these switches as \"KCC\". They remain listed here as SKCC until Alps's apparent inconsistent naming is better understood.\nDescription\n-----------\n\\[edit | edit source\\]\nConventionally, the pins are to the side of the switch instead of the front/back. Some keyboards have the switches rotated by 90° with the same pin orientation as SKCL/SKCM, and at least one keyboard used mixed orientations. While the switch may appear rotationally symmetrical, and with a bit of force a cap can be pressed onto a switch in any orientation, the switch is not rotationally symmetrical. There are nubs on the sliders (the exact location of which can vary depending on the variant) that mate with indentations inside the keycap mount. Thus keyboards that have mixed orientation for their switches do not do so arbitrarily but rotate the switches to ensure that the nubs are properly aligned with the indentations inside the keycap mount. Plate mounting holes are 14 mm square.\nThe series dates back at least as far as 1979.

Manufacturing lifetime appears to have had a substantial overlap with Alps SKCL/SKCM series: SKCC has been found with black, grey, tall white and short white switchplates.

When opening a switch, it helps to insert a thin object underneath the tab on one side, prior to opening the tab on the other side, to stop the tab on the other side from closing again. The cocktail stick method used with Alps SKCL/SKCM series is not possible with SKCC, as the ledge that rests on the mounting plate overhangs the tabs.\n*   ![Fragile side tabs](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Alps_SKCCAF_--_fragile_side_tabs.jpg \"Fragile side tabs\") Fragile side tabs\n*   ![Opening a switch](https://wiki.themk.org/index.php/File:Alps_SKCC_--_opening.jpg \"Opening a switch\") Opening a switch\nVariants\n--------\n\\[edit | edit source\\]\nFew part numbers have been recovered. To date, there is tentative evidence to suggest that subseries \"A\" comprises the tall momentary switches, and subseries \"B\" comprises the standard height momentary switches. More data is required to confirm this theory.\nThe height of the black and grey variants have not been measured, and are unclear.\nSlider and keystem height measurements are approximate and averaged from multiple switches, rather than being taken from any specifications. The keystem height is measured from the circular base through which it protrudes to the top of the slider.
